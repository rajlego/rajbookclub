This requires learning storytelling, framing, and self-inquiry. You’ll have to ask yourself uncomfortable questions, answer them honestly, and actually do the things that you know you must do. Part of that involves learning to make it easier for yourself to do things. You shouldn’t have to be straining terribly just to live your life.

This requires cultivating courage, kindness, and, perhaps most importantly, a genuine sense of humor. As Alan Watts said, “humor and self-righteousness are mutually exclusive”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introspect is about coming home to yourself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A lot of people struggle with feeling “spiritually homeless”, or like they are aliens in their own bodies, like they can’t face themselves, their anger, their grief, their neediness, their resentment, their mistakes, their heavy, heavy hearts. I thrashed and struggled through this torment myself – it took me a good 10 years of my life – and I came out the other side of it feeling lucid, centred, free.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Introspect is the guidebook I wish someone had written for me.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">Light the heart-beacon, illuminate the fog</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A recurring metaphor I will use throughout the book is the idea of “illuminating the fog”. You could think of the fog as anything that makes it difficult for you to see clearly. The fog clouds your perception, making it hard to see yourself, your circumstances, your peers, everything. The fog is what’s “in the way”. The fog can seldom be completely dispelled – and trying too hard can make it worse, like kicking up a dust cloud – but it’s worth learning to navigate it more skillfully. The more self-aware you become, the better you are able to conduct yourself with grace, the more it will dissipate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="430" height="430" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Beacon in a dark fog, by Adam Straus (2012)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s13" style=" background-color: #000;">What is the fog, exactly?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brain fog</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There are many layers to it, which is part of why people struggle to navigate it. At the physical layer, there’s something people call “<b>brain fog</b>”. It isn’t <i>technically </i>a medical condition, but so many people describe struggling with it that you can Google it and find results from medical establishments. People describe experiencing confusion, forgetfulness, a lack of clarity, inability to think. A general sense of malaise, numbness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We can point at the apparent sources of some of these problems: volatile blood sugar levels, lack of sleep, lack of exercise, stress, mental fatigue, and exhaustion. People who want to help often offer “tactical” suggestions – “fix your sleep, use blackout blinds!” “fix your diet, use smaller portion sizes!” “start exercising, do 10 pushups every day!”. While tactical suggestions can and do help – physical activity can make <i>such </i>an important difference! – I do believe that the deeper issue tends to be more fundamental. The reason I believe most people continue to struggle is that these problems tend to be <i>misframed</i>, and they also tend to have deeper underlying “root causes”. And these root causes can sometimes be very surprising to uncover.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ugh ﬁelds</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Why surprising? Well, that brings us to “<b>ugh fields</b>”. Here’s the LessWrong summary: <i>“Pavlovian conditioning can cause humans to unconsciously flinch from even thinking about a serious personal problem they have, we call it an &quot;Ugh Field&quot;. The Ugh Field forms a</i></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">self-shadowing blind spot <span class="s1">covering an area desperately in need of optimization, imposing huge costs.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Which is to say, </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">the body-mind </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">generates </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">a protective fog to keep you from facing things that</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">make you uncomfortable</span><span class="p">. I’ve come to believe that discomfort is significantly “a bodily experience”. (I’m not sure how deeply I can get into that in this version of this book. I’m still learning and figuring this out too. I’ll share my notes, and I gladly welcome any input you might have to help me make subsequent versions of the book better.)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cultural fog</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Alongside the physical experience of brain fog, and the self-shadowing blind spots we’ll call Ugh Fields, there’s also “<b>social bloatware</b>”, or “<b>cultural fog</b>”. (Bloatware refers to pre-existing stuff that gets installed on your devices for you, without your consent.) We are all born and raised amongst other people, and from them we inherit lots of things, both good and bad. Basically everything! Language, for starters, but also assumptions, beliefs, ways of thinking, ways of seeing, ways of being. We inherit ideas about what is acceptable and what is not, what is good, desirable. We inherit the traumas and anxieties of our predecessors, their taboos, their worries. For some people, this is primarily about childhood trauma: your relationship with your parents, your early childhood development. <i>“They fuck you up your mom and dad,” </i>wrote Philip Larkin.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“They may not mean to, but they do.

And add some extra, just for you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But oh, it doesn’t stop there! There’s gender, and ethnicity, and nationality… we are born in the middle of many, many ongoing stories – massive, large-scale conflicts that can take years to even begin to perceive. Some of us can get psychologically maimed in ways that we don’t even notice. We’re typically too busy to even properly notice. There’s just so much work to do first, isn’t there? Hey, why IS there such a never-ending amount of work to do, anyway? Oh, boy, when you start investigating <i>that</i>…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spiritual fog</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Lately it’s become somewhat fashionable to talk about “the meaning crisis”. I get a lot of DMs from people who describe feeling “spiritually homeless”. This too can be described as a kind of fog. Let’s call it a <b>“spiritual fog”</b>. And I wonder, maybe this is what Nietzsche was talking about all the way back in 1882, when he wrote <i>“God is dead… and we have killed him”</i>? Society (particularly Western society, and globalization means we are all Westerners now to some degree) broadly dethroned the idea of a central illuminating figure – He who said “Let There Be Light” – and some might argue that the result has been that large swathes of humanity have plunged into a great fog.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">We went on to have two major World Wars, which resulted in unfathomable death and destruction. I believe that we are still living with the downstream consequences of those wars today. Many people – intellectuals, artists – became tremendously bleak in their outlooks, and some will say we’ve never recovered. I know people who believe that many have “given up”, that a lot of our architecture, our literature, our media, our ways of being... have become selfish, small, consumerist. It can seem like the very ideas of virtue and wisdom have become passé, and that we are destined to live in a dreary postmodern sludge of uninspired, ironic dreck, obsessing about making a little more money, getting a few more Likes on social media, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="627" height="353" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_003.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Good Place (S2E04) – Existential Crisis</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Must life really be dreary, devoid of zest and exuberance?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I remember vividly when I felt in my bones that this was inescapably so. But today, I feel the opposite. I believe life can be fun, nourishing, a glorious adventure, full of surprise and delight, while we work cheerfully to make life better for ourselves and each other. I did originally believe this as a child – I had my heart broken as a teenager and young adult – and I tenderly, gingerly reassembled my broken heart back together, like one of those cool Japanese kintsugi bowls with gold in the cracks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="483" height="361" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I find myself thinking that you could say that this book is about “how do you mend your heart” – which sounds a little cheesy, but there’s really no escaping cheesiness in this endeavor. In fact, the aversion to cheesiness, frivolity, childishness, silliness is precisely the problem for a lot of people: a tyranny of solemnity chokes the playful joy out of existence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How does one undergo a change of heart?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And “heart” is important, here, because it’s quite a bit more involved than merely changing one’s mind. It’s not about “mere opinion” or “mere sentiment” either. It’s a deep, profound, felt sense of one’s place in the world. I intend this to be a “secular” book, but in doing my research I’ve noticed that the idea of a change of heart does recurringly crop up in religious contexts:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Martin Luther (of 95 theses fame) was going through a period of deep spiritual despair, saying </span><span class="s1">“I lost touch with Christ the Savior and Comforter, and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul”</span><span class="p">. His mentor Johann </span><span class="s1">“pointed Luther’s mind away from continual reflection upon his sins towards the merits of Christ”</span><span class="p">, and </span><span class="s1">“taught that </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">true repentance does not involve self-inflicted</span><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">penances and punishments but rather a change of heart</span><span class="s1">.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s a similar riff in A Thinking Person’s Guide to Islam – <i>“As regards faith, its seat is in the heart. It involves a change of the soul for the better.”</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I’ve since kept an eye out for this sort of phrasing and I noticed it again when reading about John Stuart Mill. In Section V of his autobiography, he describes asking himself if he would be happy if his utilitarian goals were achieved, </span><span class="s1">“And </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">answered, “No!”</span><span class="s1"> At this my heart sank within me, the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.” </span><span class="p">Oof! (He went on to describe how it was the work of poets and artists that lifted his spirits, which is very much my own experience as well.)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I promise, I’m not going to sell you on any particular religion or faith.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I consider myself agnostic, personally. What I do want to say is – I will always remember how, in my darkest days, my own heart felt ominously, paralyzingly heavy. I felt trapped, crushed, suffocated – I specifically remember thinking that my life was a hideous jail sentence with extra steps. I felt like I was dragging my lifeless body around a grotesquely meaningless ordeal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In the depths of this despair, what actually “saved” me was spiritual levity. Humor. I can’t remember the precise specifics, but for some reason I ended up listening to Alan Watts’ lectures on YouTube, and I tell you, that man had such a cheeky way of talking about solemn, serious and grave matters of life and death, I had to burst out laughing at my own despair, almost against my own will. (I believe Allie Brosh of Hyperbole and a Half describes something similar where, while crying on her kitchen floor, she spotted a shriveled piece of corn under the refrigerator, and the absurdity of the moment somehow broke through the edifice of her depression.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="508" height="302" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html" class="s2" target="_blank">Hyperbole and a Half – Depression Part Two</a><span style=" color: #1154CC; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;"> </span>(2013)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you’re despairing right now, I can’t guarantee that I’ll definitely be able to get you to laugh your way out of it. These things annoyingly tend not to happen on demand. But I can promise you that many people <i>have </i>found their way out of despair, and that a lot of us are eager to do what we can to help the next person who’s struggling. I believe that that knowledge itself can be a valuable thing. Please know that, even if there’s no one in your immediate life right now who cares or understands, there are people out there who do.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And you know who’s always got your back? Artists.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Musicians. Authors. Poets. People have been making art for millennia, sometimes in the darkest of times. Olivier Messiaen composed “Quartet for the End of Time” while he was interred in a German camp during World War II. Why do they do it? They do it for you. They do it to ease your burden, to soothe your spirit on this absurd voyage we call life. I highly, highly recommend that you assemble all of your favorite art – anything that has ever moved you – and keep it close to your heart, as talismans, on a personal altar of devotion to the human spirit. <i>This will keep your spirit alive. Your spirit is precious and valuable and deserving of nourishment.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">To me, artists are the Keepers of the Light of Human Consciousness, and with our words and songs and pictures and movies, we have held each other since the dawn of time. You could say that that’s my religion. Every street artist, every busker, every painter, and even in shitposters on Twitter who tweet with love and encouragement – in every one of them, when I look in their eyes, I can feel in my heart the stirring revelation that God isn’t dead at all. We are her, and she is us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">A warning</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s10">If there’s anything in this book that you find dispiriting, you should probably disregard it, or otherwise try to reframe it in a way that’s compelling to you.</span><span class="s21" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;"> It’s</span><span class="s10"> </span><span class="s21" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">your voice that’s important, not mine.</span><span class="s10"> There is no point trying to force yourself to do something that you don’t find compelling.

Some people might read a book like this thinking, “Hm, that guy seems trustworthy, I should trust him instead of myself.” I want to caution against that. I’m just some guy. Yeah, I’ve done a lot of work to try and be rigorous in my thinking, but my thinking is informed by my own experiences, my own contexts. </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">It would be a mistake to assume that </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">my </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">truths necessarily correspond perfectly</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">to </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">your </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">experience.</span><span class="p"> They might not.

There is a lot more that I wanted to do, but simply didn’t have the time, space or skill to handle artfully. Writing a book is HARD! I will likely continue reworking this book for decades to come. I want you to see that it’s a bit of a mess, like a half-finished painting in a chaotic artist’s studio. If anything seems “off”, you’re probably right.

The reader “doesn’t need to know”, and they might not even notice. But I think INTROSPECT is a book that’s supposed to be fundamentally <i>honest</i>, amidst all the bullshit that’s peddled everywhere. So I’ll tell the truth about how I feel, marketing and branding be damned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I have tried to squeeze everything I know into this book. I don’t think I have succeeded, not even close. George Orwell said that every book is a failure. This one is, too. It’s not as elegant as I want it to be. It doesn’t include all the beautiful things I wanted to include. Worst of all, I feel that some of the sections lack “animating spirit”, which I think is the most important thing that a book should have – especially a book that’s an attempt to demonstrate my own animating spirit, in the hope that it might help you animate your own!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I hope that you’ll look past my errors and imperfections and <i>see what I’m trying to gesture at. </i>I’m ultimately shipping this as an act of desperation because I don’t want it to languish in my drafts for years. This has, for me, been a lesson in acceptance and surrender. “I deserve peace,” I find myself reflecting in the final days of my editing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">One way of thinking about this book is that it’s a “platform” – and all of the Acts, and the Sections within those Acts, are trying to gesture at a greater whole (jokingly called the Jewel Of Life). The problem is, I’m not a good enough author yet to do justice to it. I’ve already spent 3 years working on this book, and I feel like I could continue working on it indefinitely.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, I want to publish it and get it out of my system, so that I can get feedback from other people, and work that feedback into future editions of the book. I hope you will find some value in it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you find yourself disappointed, frustrated or underwhelmed by any part of this book, I’ll be happy to hear it – @ me on Twitter (@visakanv) with a screenshot, and I’ll make a note to address it in the next version.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">What to expect</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Introspect follows the classic Hero’s Journey structure, which was popularized by Joseph Campbell, and continues to be used as an underlying screenwriting formula in many blockbuster movies. You might not be Iron Man or Wonder Woman, but you are the main character of your own life, and the lessons from this classic storytelling structure remain eternal, relevant and valuable!</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="554" height="549" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Not all stories necessarily follow the Hero’s Journey – that would be boring as hell – but I believe that the Journey itself keeps reappearing because it maps onto the emotional and psychological challenges that we all go through. As I’ve been writing this book, it occurred to me that, while I thought I understood this stuff – I mean it all seems so obvious! – there is an infinite amount of nuance to explore here. Challenges and conflicts are eternal, and so eternally interesting, and studying them is eternally useful. I hope I can convey some of that to you.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INTROSPECT is separated into ﬁve Acts:</p><ol id="l21"><li><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 19pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -24pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Call To Adventure <span class="p">– Heeding the personal yearning for sovereignty.

A feeling that something is not quite right about oneself, or the world. The realization that everything that you’ve called life, up until now, is really a sort of “sanitized bubble reality”, that’s constrained by something you previously didn’t quite perceive.

Some people try to ignore this, but it’s difficult to ignore it for very long because it’ll begin to show up in your life, sometimes in strange ways. As Jung said, until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. The only way out is through.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">For me when I think about my own experience of this, I think of books and libraries, which </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">radicalized me into seeing that life could be a glorious adventure</span><span class="p">. When I was a young child, the world seemed exciting, full of promise. And then I had to go to school, which felt like prison. And a lot of my life has been about navigating this tension between adventure and ordeal. Along the way I’ve heard from a lot of people who’ve also struggled with this, and a lot of my work – including this book – is an attempt on my part to help people with that.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I might be naive, but I believe that your life – no matter what ordeals you’re struggling with – can be a glorious adventure too. Let’s see if we can help you frame it that way.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s29" style=" background-color: #000;">Overview of Act I: The Call to Adventure</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Act I is about waking up to the world you inhabit, the ignorant bliss of childhood, the series of breaches of sanitized bubble realities (the womb, the family unit, peer group, &quot;society&quot;), the emotional realities of the struggles to come.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l23"><ol id="l24"><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">The desire for sovereignty</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">The adventure begins with a stirring in the heart: to go somewhere, do something, be somebody. Almost everybody has some desire for sovereignty. Many people struggle with having this desire, especially when it brings them into conflict with the world around them: their family, their peers, their community, “society”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">This conflict is typically the scariest and most painful experience a person has up until that point.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Suppressing the desire makes it worse. It&#39;ll then retaliate via &quot;shadow sovereignty&quot;, which is beyond your conscious influence. So you must learn to accept your heart’s desire for sovereignty, and learn to negotiate with it. You can eventually build a healthy and loving relationship with it, and become much stronger as a result.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 192pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: left;">Execute the jailbreak</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Existence can feel like a jail sentence sometimes. Everywhere you turn, there are constraints, pitfalls, rules and regulations. You have bills to pay, responsibilities to keep up with, live up to. It can all be quite suffocating, and worse, it can be outright dispiriting. Shitty circumstances are real, but it takes some cunning, preparation, and courage to even get a shot at breaking free from them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">In reality, we are not in a singular jail, but in an infinite kaleidoscope of constraints and obstacles. The important thing is to not allow your heart to be “institutionalized” – to meekly accept its fate as a helpless caged bird. And above all else, <i>do not be the one to imprison yourself.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 200pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: left;">Refusal of the call</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">The call to adventure is fundamentally about scheming to go past the threshold of the unknown. There is wisdom in resisting this call, and in being scared. It means that you&#39;re sane. The fear in your body is your ally, it will keep you safe. Talk with it. Dance with it. Make friends with it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Do not try to overpower it with bluster and bravado, or to reject it without facing it. Instead, do the work of earning its respect.

Another way of putting it is that they are unable to “accept their fate”. Not all of them will necessarily agree with this assessment right away, perhaps because they might not have even thought to think of it in these terms.

They usually know that it’s not the smartest or wisest decision to make in the grand scheme of things. But what’s important to them at the moment is that they exercise their sovereignty, to make decisions that are <i>theirs</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you’re a parent who’s suppressive and controlling, your teenager’s desire for sovereignty may be likelier to express itself in shocking, startling, unexpected ways. So what you have to do – which can be difficult, and scary, is to give them some space to make their own mistakes, and to be clear to them that you love them no matter what, and that they can trust you, and that you’ll listen to them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Spoiler: This entire dynamic plays out internally within yourself, too.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.

It might seem rude to say this about people who are struggling, but, with love, in a way we bullshit ourselves to cope with the pain.

And these metaphors are helpful! You can think about how you would want to open up if you have to, with the least possible damage. You might put some kind of soft mattress below the crockery. You might get someone else to stand by, ready to catch the falling plates. You might have to accept that there <i>will </i>be some damage, and be prepared to sweep up the broken plates. Or maybe you might have to do something even more complicated like slowly tilt the entire cupboard backwards onto it’s back, which is quite a tedious operation that you will definitely need help with.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is a wisdom in being afraid.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think what I’m trying to say here is, there’s often some kind of wisdom to the refusal of the call.

I do remember being righteously angry about some social issues. But if you asked me “are you an emotional person,” there would’ve been contexts where I’d have denied it, because I had this simplistic dichotomy in my head where you’re either “rational” or “emotional”, which is a far too binary way of thinking about it. I think I might have sometimes said “I’m passionate!”, which in retrospect was a pretty good reframe at the time, actually.

I choose to include it because I want to convey my sincere belief that everybody struggles sometimes, including people who write books about how to deal with struggles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: -3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">I’ll be honest: this book has been kicking my ass. It’s quite possibly the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It’s difficult, scary, overwhelming. I’ve written over a million words, over a thousand blogposts, over 160,000 tweets, had thousands of conversations with people, but somehow this is harder. I held down a job for 5.5 years where I had deadlines and obligations and meetings and so on, and somehow this feels harder. Maybe there’s a recency bias to it. But I do think that this is the most ambitious project I’ve ever undertaken, and it became clear to me pretty early on that it’s too big for me to handle. Carl Jung started writing his Red Book in his late 30s, and it took him almost 20 years to complete. I’m only 31, and I’m not Carl Jung. And I know it sounds arrogant and dramatic to say “this is my Red Book”, but it kind of is, although it surely “falls short” in multiple dimensions. But nevertheless this is what I have, this is who I am, this is where I’m at, and this is what I’m doing. And so even as I whine and gripe and grovel and cry internally about it, I’m going to lovingly drag myself to the finish line.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">I think I want to talk a bit about the specifics of the stresses involved. At one level, this book is meant to be a collection of tips and suggestions to help people with their personal challenges. But I can summarize that stuff in a few sentences, it’s maybe about 20 tweets or so. I’ve summarized it in a separate document, I summarize it again at the end of the book, I will summarize it over and over again as part of my process of figuring it out. That’s what Do 100 Thing is about. And yet there’s a part of me that thinks, that’s not enough. Simply giving people a bunch of tips is not enough. When I was growing up I remember reading all sorts of tips and tricks and lifehacks and so on, but it never quite</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">seemed enough.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 4pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">What was missing? I think what was missing was a sense of the internal workings of the matter. It’s about emotions, it’s about feelings, it’s about vibes. And so I’m including this section – and maybe I’ll include another section like this later in the book, I’m just freestyling here – because I think it’s important to break from the structure of the book to make an effort to represent the unstructured freestyle of the semi-subconscious mind bursting through. The thing I wanted to know so bad, when I was a teenager, was what the fuck this stuff is like from the inside. This is also part of why I’ve resisted the idea of getting an editor for this book. There’s something about this particular book to me that feels like it should be written independently. Maybe that’s conceit on my part. Maybe it’s</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">cowardice. Nevertheless I’ve reflected on it and it feels correct to me. Part of what makes this book different from other books is that there was no editor. It’s just me. I did get some feedback from friends early on, which was really helpful, and I might get my wife</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">to read the final draft when I print it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">I can tell you about some of the things that are annoying me about this book. It’s already too long, for starters, and yet simultaneously it doesn’t say enough. There’s so much I’m leaving unsaid– there are some things I can’t remember, there are some things I might not even be consciously aware of. And I repeat myself a bunch of times, more than is elegant. But I’m realizing that I simply don’t currently possess the skill to resolve this right now. I might need to write and publish several more books before I gain the embodied insight I need to make this book the book that I want it to be. If I’m not careful, I could let this book languish in the drafts for 20, 30 more years. But I’m choosing to try and get it to a point that I find tolerable, and publish it within the next</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">few days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">I’ve been thinking about the idea of ruins. The idea that cities are sometimes (often?) built on top of the ruins of older cities, and that maybe books are written on top of the ruins of older books. When Steven Spielberg was 17, he made a sci-fi film called Firelight, on a budget of $500. It was sort of an early practice run for his subsequent films, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T. I suppose you could say this is my Firelight. There are things that I can only know about how to write a book after I’ve written one. My first ebook, Friendly Ambitious Nerd, isn’t really a book at all – it’s more of a collection of blogposts and twitter threads. And I won’t be surprised if some people say, well, FAN was better than INTROSPECT, because it was easier to read, less convoluted, less complicated, less tedious, less noisy, less messy. And yet I have to say… all of this mess is important. I can’t entirely explain why yet. But it’s important. And including this section in this book is important too, I just realized this in the shower earlier. Because it’s what I do that’s different than what almost every other goddamn book seems to do. While I recognize the value of tight and sharp editing, purpose-driven writing, clear telegraphing and so on, I also recognize the value of chaos. But using chaos artfully is hard. I can’t claim to be good at it. All I can say is that I’m trying.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 309pt;text-indent: -49pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">What I would really appreciate, actually, is if someone reading this book found this particular section more valuable than the others.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 258pt;text-indent: 138pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">Maybe it’s me. Maybe it’s enough if that someone is me.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="h2" style=" background-color: #EFEFEF;">ACT II.

How do you persist? How do you stay motivated? That’s a matter of managing your psychology! It’s about the story you tell yourself. It’s about how you choose to respond to failure and disappointment. Everything else is “just” logistics – pushing buttons, pulling levers, putting one foot in front of the other.

Once you have the metaphorical sword (and thread) in your hands, you’re no longer just a hapless villager – you are now some kind of warrior, someone who’s at least marginally equipped to face challenges. This itself can be daunting and unpleasant to people. It deviates from their self-image as helpless, weak, being the victim of forces beyond their control. And the thing is, it’s true!

I wouldn’t worry about it too early. You can get to 100 pages of introspection without worrying about it, but once you get to several hundred pages it starts to become a concern. At this point you want to index your notes. Write evocative titles. Use directives. Ask questions. It’s good if you can start out with a simple index, but I wouldn’t worry</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">too much about it. Specifically, don’t let your worry about <i>potential </i>chaos keep you from getting started. Some amount of chaos is not a bad thing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Repetitiveness</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is something that’s actually annoying me right now with my own journaling, and it’s not the first time (ha.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I personally used to struggle quite a bit with this – and writing about it now, </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">I realize it’s not the</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">repetition itself that was the problem, but my assumptions and beliefs about what that repetition</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">meant.</span><span class="p"> (Foreshadowing: problems!)

Basically, the core idea is that all creativity begins with imitation, and there is simply no way to be absolutely “original”. The Beatles started as a cover band. Sony started as a radio repair shop. Everything a person can come up with is a remix of what they know, what they have seen, what they have heard and so on. Even if you try to come up with something that you’ve never seen, that negative space is defined in relation to all that you <i>have </i>seen. And even if you somehow come up with something absolutely unique with no relationship to anything else, your audience will need to relate it to their own experience in order to make sense of it, and so they will still perceive it as a remix of what they know.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">This is great news for artists and creators! It means you should never have to worry about being original, and that you should be thrilled to repeat yourself for the rest of your career.

My first instinct is to say, “Don’t worry about that, just keep going, it’ll all make sense eventually!” But I’m not sure if that’s actually helpful for someone who doesn’t feel like they’re getting very much out of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I definitely don’t want you to feel like you’re forcing yourself to do something that you’re not enjoying, not getting any value out of. That just worsens the larger problem of not being able to trust yourself. I would say… try and keep it small, simple, low-effort… but also try to dig a little</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">deeper. Ask yourself questions that you wish someone would ask you. Try to get a sense of what’s really bothering you at any point in time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’m reminded of conversations I’ve had with people who don’t like books, who can’t get themselves or their kids to read. And… for me, it was never anything like this. Books were always exciting to me, because it was an opportunity to inhabit the mind of authors who care about me, and I was starving for that as a child.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Maybe the question to ask is, what are you starving for, in life? What do you wish you had? Who do you wish you had in your life? And how can you simulate that in your journaling?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“All you need to write a script is paper and pencil.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Akira Kurosawa, influential and highly-esteemed filmmaker</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l32"><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">Pick up a notebook and a pen<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Or otherwise fire up your most familiar notes app. The good thing about paper notebooks is that there’s no backspace, and it’s very satisfying in a tactile way to fill out page after page.

You don’t have to share this with anybody else. Don’t try to “write well”. In fact, if you’re feeling it, “write badly” on purpose.

Try to keep this going for at least about 10-15 minutes if you can. If your mind starts to wander, just write down your wandering thoughts. None of this has to make sense, or be “useful” in any way. Think about how a classroom of students might start socializing and doing random nonsense when the teacher leaves the room on an errand. You’re the teacher in your classroom. Leave the room.

Sometimes people accidentally find themselves writing hundreds and hundreds of words in one go, which is a fabulously cathartic release. But don’t worry about it if you only get a small trickle of a few words. That’s okay.

See if anything jumps out at you. The real value of this likely won’t be apparent until months or even years later, when you look back on it and notice little clues and tells that you can’t perceive in the moment.

That’s completely fine, it’s a great place to start. Once you’ve been doing it for a while, I recommend doing monthly reviews, and eventually annual reviews.

And… I’m not going to dismiss that entirely, but rather I want to focus on the fact that – when you find something that resonates with you, <i><b>you </b></i><i>are resonating with it</i>.

There is a clarity in fiction, whereas reality tends to be complex, complicated, and often not make narrative sense. It’s always tempting to try and condense the infinite complexity of reality into a singular, simplistic narrative. It’s satisfying, but it’s also dangerous. It’s important to realize that whatever stories we’re telling ourselves about anything, it’s almost never the full picture. Each way of seeing, which can be eye-opening, perspective-widening, can also be limiting, like a pair of blinders. “We only see what we want to see.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The challenge here, when articulating your own story, is to try to find a balance – it can be helpful and clarifying to have something simple, but it’s important to recognize that nothing is ever the whole picture.

Reflecting on this always makes me question and rethink how I’m framing things in my own life. I typically find that the first, obvious, intuitive choice is rarely the best one. If you experiment with your frames – zoom in, zoom out, change the angle, you’ll likely find a better one that achieves a better effect.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You get to choose what you want to focus on!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This isn’t obvious to everyone, because people are conditioned to “pay attention” and focus on what they’re told to focus on. Sovereignty is about exercising the freedom to focus on what YOU want to focus on. And, inversely, tyranny is the use of coercion to enforce frames, controlling what people can see, think, feel, believe, experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="623" height="449" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_026.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">(^ one of my many tweets on framing)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">School is a very rigid frame.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s a fixed curriculum, a fixed pedagogy (which is simply the dominant method of delivering that curriculum), and probably most frustrating of all, a fixed system of standardized testing, which atomizes individuals and conditions us to think of one another as competitors in fixed, finite games. We are graded on bell curves based on our ability to perform on bureaucratic tests. People subjected to years and years of rigid frames end up living with rigid frames themselves. This can be soul-crushing. Real life can be much more beautifully complex than this.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Inﬁnite gaming is about playing with frames.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When people first start experimenting with frames, it looks foolish and silly and we make fun of them. This discourages a lot of people, which makes them give up. When the few people who keep at it get good at it, we call them geniuses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Arthur Schopenhauer</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The reason no one else can see the target is because they’re seeing through frames that don’t allow them to see it. Look again at the picture above from Ted Nelson’s book. Genius hits a target that’s outside the conventional frame. People sometimes talk about this by using the concept of the “Overton window”, which is really just a way of saying “the mainstream conventional frame”. Similarly, when people say “think outside the box”, they mean, try framing things differently than what is conventionally familiar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="207" height="354" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_027.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The challenge is, it’s very hard to perceive the boundaries of your perception.

It can feel like there’s “nothing to stand on”. Truly, deeply experimenting with frames can be a disorienting experience. Some people think that most people can’t handle it. I don’t know. Maybe. I believe anybody can get better at it. Total disorientation can be blissful or terrifying, even both.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here’s a Joseph Campbell quote that captures the spirit of this:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s22">“The LSD phenomenon [...] is an intentionally achieved schizophrenia, with the expectation of a spontaneous remission—which, however, does not always follow. Yoga, too, is intentional schizophrenia: </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">one breaks away from the world,</span><span class="s22"> </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">plunging inward, and the ranges of vision experienced are in fact the same as</span><span class="s22"> </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">those of a psychosis</span><span class="s22">. But what, then, is the difference? What is the difference between a psychotic or LSD experience and a yogic, or a mystical? The plunges are all into the same deep inward sea; of that there can be no doubt. The symbolic figures encountered are in many instances identical (and I shall have something more to say about those in a moment). But there is an important difference. The difference—to put it sharply—is equivalent simply to that between a diver who can swim and one who cannot. The mystic, endowed with native talents for this sort of thing and following, stage by stage, the instruction of a master, enters the waters and finds he can swim; whereas the </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">schizophrenic,</span><span class="s22"> </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">unprepared, unguided, and ungifted, has fallen or has intentionally plunged, and</span><span class="s22"> </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">is drowning</span><span class="s22">.”</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Joseph Campbell</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’m still figuring out how to navigate this with other people, because in this Campbellian sense, I’m a mostly self-taught “mystic” or “shaman” who’s figured things out through reading, thinking, journaling, experimentation, my own trial-and-error. I assume that, if I can do it, surely others should be able to do it too? I can’t know this for sure until I share these ideas with many more people and hear about their experiences. There’s some risk involved here, which is part of why</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’ve been taking so long with this book. I want to make sure I don’t encourage irresponsible, dangerous behavior. I hope that comes through!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I also want to share one of my favorite Richard Feynman quotes, which I think pairs nicely with Campbell’s:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“I think it&#39;s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don&#39;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#39;re here. I don&#39;t have to know an answer. I don&#39;t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Richard Feynman</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Social violations</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A common “failure” mode for beginners first starting out is to violate frames for violation’s sake. This rhymes with how young people exercise their sovereignty by making bad decisions. It might be a stupid frame but it’s <i>their </i>frame.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is not an intrinsically bad thing, but it can have bad consequences that you’ll then have to deal with. It really depends on how egregiously you choose to violate mainstream frames. I strongly advocate for an incremental approach. There’s no need to be in a rush to offend others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“If a problem can&#39;t be solved within the frame it was conceived, the solution lies in reframing the problem.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Brian McGreevy, Hemlock Grove</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="504" height="382" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_028.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.roccoundseinebrueder.com/outdoor-detail/art-in-a-frame/" class="s2" target="_blank">Art In A </a><span style=" color: #1154CC; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11pt;">Frame</span>, by Berlin graffiti artists “Rocco and his Brothers”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playfully experiment with different points of view.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When evaluating any particular problem, ask yourself, what is the frame here?

I wish there were a simple, elegant soundbite I could give you to help you navigate this effectively, but there isn’t really one. To play infinite games well in a world that has a lot of finite players requires that you develop a pretty good understanding of those finite games. Well – it depends on your priorities, and your values.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I personally think that we should make at least a moderate good-faith effort to avoid unnecessarily hurting or upsetting people with our play. But sometimes this is almost unavoidable. As mentioned earlier, sometimes simply exercising your own sovereignty over your own life is something that might trigger a negative reaction from friends and family who are hostile to the very idea. Navigating this requires finesse that can take time and experience to develop. I can’t say that it’ll be easy. But I do want to point out that progress is almost always possible, if not always in the most ideal way that you’d like.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s13" style=" background-color: #000;">Experiment with your frames</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">We are always operating within some frame.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">We do not always have to accept the default frames that we inherit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Cruel, abusive people – authoritarian tyrants – will insist on defining our frames for us.

They do a lot of overgeneralizing, for example going from “I can’t seem to study for this test” to “I can’t do anything right.” It’s sad to see.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I remember this feeling. The important thing is that you understand that you are not the first person to be overwhelmed. It’s not bad to be overwhelmed. Anybody who is intellectually honest will be overwhelmed! This is normal, and it can even be good, in a sense – because it means that you’re not buying into some simplistic comforting bullshit. (Think again about the “sanitized bubble reality” we talked about in The Call To Adventure.) This will actually save you some pain in the long run – though I know that isn’t particularly reassuring to hear right now.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Write down exactly what it is that’s overwhelming you.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you do this, you will find that it’s actually fewer things than it feels like in your gut. And you can define them precisely, and then take steps to address those things one by one. And making progress feels good! It feels good to “level up” even if you don’t slay the dragon overnight. You want to develop a sense of what your quest actually is. What the steps are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think there are people – parents, teachers, etc – who may even think that it’s actually kind of good if kids panic and catastrophize about their grades, their poor attention spans, their failures. “Good! Be scared! Life is scary! Don’t get comfortable! Work harder!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Maybe some kids respond well to this. I absolutely fucking didn’t. And I think I’ve seen like hundreds of thousands of people retweeting tweets over the years that basically agree that that sort of shit didn’t really help them either. It just terrorizes them needlessly. It’s really tragic if you end up bullying people thinking that you protect them. And yes, this applies inwardly inside your own head to you, too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think the real power move with kids is to be as precisely truthful and honest about reality as you can.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This means trusting them, which I think many adults typically hesitate to do because they’re fearful themselves, that they will be blamed if the kid doesn’t do well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I can’t speak for all kids, but I can speak for my kid-self, who I swore to represent well into my adulthood. I sincerely believe that I would have worked really hard if I was given proper structure and guidance. I wasn’t. I was just terrorized into an unproductive panic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You can see me working really hard now! I’ve written over a million words, and I’ve been publishing videos almost every day. Nobody is slave-driving or terrorizing me into it.

It makes no sense to me. You can’t know that about yourself with that much certainty.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">I ask (gently), what is it that you’re trying to do? And the vague grandiosities come flying again, <i>“I’m trying to stop fucking up in life!” </i>Again I don’t really buy your assessment of the situation – “fucking up” is too broad, what do you want to do, exactly?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I want to do well in school!” <span class="p">–Why?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Here some kids say things like, <i>“Oh, aren’t all kids supposed to do well in school? if I don’t, my parents will be disappointed, my friends will laugh at me, [long paragraph]… I will be a failure, my life will be ruined, I will die sad and alone…”</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Okay, pause.

Nobody asks them that. <i>“What matters the most… to me?” </i>(does not compute) <i>“Everything!!! Everything is chaos, life is a nightmare!!” </i>Yes, okay. I’m sorry to hear that kid. but I’m still curious: In this nightmare, which is the biggest monster?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The conversation can go many directions from here, depending on the kid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Latest breakthrough with latest kid: he came to see that he wasn’t being entirely honest with himself about his own goals and interests. He didn’t even have the headspace to do that, or feel like he had permission to ask that, so he was thrashing about wildly and struggling to breathe. And it was only when he made some space to think about his goals – the desires of his sovereign soul – that he found that some of the fog began to lift.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I actually do honestly believe that kids who have a moderately clear sense of what they’re into (as clear as a kid can reasonably get, anyway), what they’re about, what they like, what their options are – will on average do better in school than a kid who’s living in terror.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Sometimes you do get a terrified kid who somehow manages to walk the tightrope between terror &amp; despair, get all their homework done, and do well. Have you seen these kids though? Sometimes they literally seem like soldiers with PTSD. There is no light in their eyes, only KPIs. It’s gruesome.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Anyway, another week, another kid who’s so desperate that they turn to an internet stranger. Why? For what? I think it’s for the hope of being seen, being listened to. Sometimes they get someone like me. But sometimes they get abusive, manipulative assholes. And that’s really dangerous.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 229%;text-align: left;">Listen to kids.

Some people pity victims, and we might not want to be pitied. Other people <i>blame </i>victims for their own abuse – “Oh, you must have been a horrible child if your parents didn’t love you!” – and that’s a really horrible, helpless place to be.

(This is also what I mean by ‘shadow sovereignty’.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And whenever &quot;taskmaster visa&quot; got tired, sloppy, etc – which would inevitably happen, and I knew this from dealing with authorities (parents, teachers) &quot;fun visa&quot; would then be ruthless about seizing control and unhealthily binging the fuck out of whatever fun he could get.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">I see now that both of those guys were scared, anxious, weak.

It&#39;s not about power over others. Nobody can have dominion over anything greater or lesser than oneself. It&#39;s about conducting oneself with grace and decency, about taking responsibility, refusing</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">self-abandonment, self-abdication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">After I went through the first cycle of this journey (and it looks like it’s probably an infinite loop), I found myself noticing when *other* guys are unintegrated, self-abdicated. and I felt this anxious compulsion to help them. It took me another cycle to realize that me pressuring them made it worse. Turns out I still have neediness in me, and I was projecting mine onto them. That I wouldn’t be okay unless they were okay. I had to learn to be okay with them being “not-okay”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Often the best thing we can do for anybody else who is struggling is to simply be a shining example of excellence ourselves.

And I hated homework, so bad. I would put it off, avoid doing it, sometimes try and do a rushed job minutes before class, sometimes copy frantically from friends. It was a lot of stress and anxiety. I would lose things, I would fail to keep track of things. It was a mess.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And… I’m sure people tried to help me, but it didn’t really work. My teachers couldn’t really help. My parents couldn’t really help. I would have to figure it out on my own, and it was a messy, painful, frustrating process. The “obvious” solution would have been to, well, do my homework before it was due. But I almost never seemed to be able to get into that headspace until it was too late. Sometimes I would do my homework immediately the moment I received it, and that would usually give me the best odds of not screwing up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="600" height="371" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">(via @joulee – senior designer’s process)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But this section is not about “how to do your homework”. I hated homework and I still do. After years of second-guessing myself and having lots of conversations with people, I now personally reject the whole structure and spirit of traditional schooling. I don’t think that’s how learning actually works, at least for me. I think real learning happens on a slightly unpredictable schedule. You can try and plan for it, and set things up to facilitate it, but you can’t <i>rush </i>it, sort of like how you can’t have a baby in 3 months.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="595" height="405" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/study-time-vs-game-time" style=" color: #424242; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank">^ I could write a whole separate section about </a><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/study-time-vs-game-time" class="s36" target="_blank">this old </a><span style=" color: #00F; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11pt;">meme</span><span class="s7">. </span><span class="p">Part of it is that gaming provides clear rewards, immediate feedback, desired outcomes. </span><span class="s14">Part of why video games are so compelling is that they do the hard work of project management for you. </span><span class="p">But the </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">“problem”</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">is that well-defined projects that are easy to participate in aren’t necessarily fulfilling ones.</span><span class="p"> The concept of “gamification” started out quite promising, but unfortunately I think it came to be associated with the superficial veneer of gaming – frills, trinkets, points, etc – when what is really required is that we investigate the fundamental structure of the systems we are trying to invigorate.

What projects did I indulge in? I know I kept a sticker book at some point, and a Digimon cards collection, almost by accident. Those didn’t *feel* like projects, even though technically I would say they do qualify. Because a collection is something that you build over time, it requires collaboration with past and future selves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I had a personal website, which was something that I built over time, and I was very proud of it. It started with a few individual HTML pages, mostly text, some images and links. And then from there I learned to create a network of pages which referenced each other, related to each other. Nobody particularly taught me to do this, I learned it myself through trial and error, partially by copying what I liked about other sites. (Today, my personal homepage is on visakanv.com, which functions as a sort of “master node” that links out to my blogposts, youtube channel, etc. I</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">consider this to be part of the same ongoing project, and it still makes me very proud and happy that I have a “home” on the web.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I also remember writing a couple of video game guides, or FAQs, which you can still find on GameFAQs.com almost 20 years later. They were really just a list of moves with a bit of commentary on them, but looking at them now, it’s remarkable to me how much effort I put into it. And these are legitimate projects! I wrote then in notepad.exe, and I remember it took me days of effort to do it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In retrospect, this was my earliest and most substantial creative work, and it laid the groundwork for me to get more comfortable writing longer blogposts and essays, and eventually, this book, and hopefully in the future, entire novels, even series of novels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Somehow, I made it happen. I went from being a cheerfully self-directed kid to someone who was anxious, overwhelmed, procrastinating, and now I’m a cheerfully self-directed adult.

It’s tempting, upon learning about the concept of project management, to feel compelled to study project management in the abstract. I don’t think that’s a very good idea. I think </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">the best way to learn about project management is to actually do things that you directly</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">care about</span><span class="p">. Learn music, write a blog, study history, do something substantial that you care about, and learn the project management skills en route to doing what you care about. If you try to learn it in the abstract, without grounding it in work that you care about, it can spiral away into more and more byzantine abstractions.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you’re one of the handful of people who are cursed with the thought “but I care about learning project management” in the abstract (you poor thing), I still think it’s best if you make the deliberate effort to learn it vicariously through another interest. It doesn’t need to be a “serious” thing.

This doesn’t work. At worst, you’ll end up hurting yourself or causing damage in some way, because you weren’t properly warmed up. At best, even if you didn’t cause any serious damage, you’ll likely find yourself struggling beyond your “healthy exertion” zone, and this tends to feel bad psychologically.

You can learn to manage that distress, but even if you haven’t yet, it functions as a hedge against focusing too hard on details that may end up irrelevant. The important thing is to be able to switch between zooming out and zooming in.

The core idea, in my view, is that you have limited resources, and you want to make sure that you deploy those limited resources as effectively as possible, in such a way that allows you to earn more resources. This means that you have to be very careful not to overstretch yourself, and instead focus on doing one thing very, very well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">(Ironically, me taking 3 years to write this book is a violation of this principle… and I will say that I’ve absolutely suffered needlessly as a consequence. But also, you could say that at this point I have already succeeded at the first couple of cycles – my first book continues to sell copies every day, which buys me time to write the second one, and to be relatively more indulgent with my process.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="547" height="301" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_036.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don’t waste time accumulating more information than you need to take action.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In 2014, I had a minor epiphany about how my experience with personal development seemed to mirror the principles of product development. I had spent over 10 years struggling to improve myself by accumulating information, which is the base of the pyramid. It’s tiring, endless and ungratifying. I came to realize that I was focused wrongly on the bottom layer, trying to “fill up” the pyramid from the bottom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Get to the peak as quickly as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Personal energy (or willpower, or motivation, whatever you want to call it) is a VERY limited resource early on. And I’m now convinced that this isn’t something you can change very much directly through sheer force of will. I’ve come to believe that the subconscious needs some proof</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">of success, or some kind of pleasure, before it will give you more energy. Hit the peak, and you unlock more energy to do more.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What is the peak? In writing, it’s publishing something and getting feedback from others, and changing your self-image in the process. You’re not a person who wants to write, you’re a person who has written. You’re a writer!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In cooking, it’s making a dish, eating it, smiling and realizing that you liked it. You want to get to that point as soon as you can. In fitness, it’s breaking a sweat, getting an elevated heart rate, going home and showering and feeling the endorphins. If you’re lifting weights, it actually means you shouldn’t lift too much too soon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Counter-intuitively, this means you should do the minimum research possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Because more research means more inertia, more time-cost, more expectations. I don’t mean “throw yourself into difficult, dangerous tasks without any preparation whatsoever”. I mean that going for a walk is 100x more helpful than researching nuances of biomechanics. Do things that are safe, small, simple, easy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How can you change your identity?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What’s the smallest, simplest, quickest thing you can do to change your identity? That’s real leverage. For me personally, “I’m a picky eater, I don’t know how to cook, have food issues” was a big part of my identity. On the 23rd of November 2014, I cooked eggs for myself for the first time. They were delicious. I’ve been much more comfortable with food ever since. And I’m also much more comfortable setting out to do almost anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Once you’ve experienced transformation in a couple of different domains, you start to see how it’s all the same thing. It’s all just project management. You start by managing your psychology, and then everything is logistics.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">What my ex-boss taught me</p><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In the 5+ years I worked for my ex-boss Dinesh, he constantly, casually-yet-intensely would ask me about my goals &amp; desired outcomes:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;What do you want to get out of this?&quot; &quot;How will you measure your progress?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s the next step?&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What&#39;s the limiting factor?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve since internalized that stuff so thoroughly, and found it so useful, that I now almost struggle to remember what it was like <i>before </i>I installed Dinesh&#39;s instrumental thinking module into my mental suite.

But, I wondered to myself, what if that might actually work, actually? What if I actually tried to draw the rest of the fucking owl? So I set out to draw some owls. These are what my first 3 attempts looked like. (I still actually really like the 3rd one, I think it’s cute and has a rather evocative mood to it.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="493" height="184" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_041.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There are children who can draw better than that. But I’m not mad about it, because it’s part of a process. I’m here to keep drawing more owls, and to observe the nuances in how things change each time. Up next is my fourth attempt. Kinda gnarly, but I’m not mad about it. I can see the shape. I can see what I was trying to do. “Spend more time getting the eyes right”, is a note I would’ve given myself. Because the eyes turn out to be the most expressive and important part of a drawing of anything with a face. Did you know that? I mean, it seems obvious once you hear it said, but I didn’t properly realize that until I drew a few owls myself. I also noticed, “Being sloppy with the shading in the middle is kinda cool, actually, and that means I don’t have to spend a lot of time drawing to be happy with the outcome.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="310" height="484" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_042.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And this is my 9th attempt at drawing an owl.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 132pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="290" height="449" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_043.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Not bad, don’t you think? It’s far from perfect, but it’s such a tremendous improvement over the first few attempts. How good do you think my 100th owl would be? I don’t think I’m going to sit around drawing another 91 owls, though, at least not anytime soon. Because I have other things I want to do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And here we arrive at another useful thing about the “Do 100 Thing” framework – sometimes you do a thing several times, witness yourself getting better at it, and then realize you don’t actually wanna invest the time and energy into getting better at it. <i>And that’s fine. </i>It’s satisfying to know that you <i>could </i>get good at something if you wanted to, but that you’d rather spend your effort on something else!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And it’s not “wasted” time, because it was time you enjoyed, witnessing yourself get better at something. That’s something you can carry with you to <i>anything else that you do</i>. For me, my experience as a writer has translated to me confidently making lots of youtube videos even though I knew nothing about videography when I started. I truly wish everyone could have that feeling of lightness, confidence, comfort with attempting things that they’re not familiar with, because it makes the world feel like a much more inviting place.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Lock yourself in a room doin&#39; five beats a day for three summers / That&#39;s a different world like three summers /</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">I deserve to do these numbers”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Kanye West, Spaceship, 2004</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I never particularly intended this, but “do 100 thing” is one of my talking points on Twitter that has really taken off and resonated with people.

The point is, if life feels chaotic and overwhelming, doing something small 100 times is a simple and effective way to get a foothold on something new. It doesn’t need to be good. It doesn’t need to be pretty. The point is to just have done something, and to do more of it than you would have if you were fucking around aimlessly. So “fuck around kinda-aimlessly but with some intent”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overwhelmed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When some people hear “do 100 thing,” they feel overwhelmed. They do their first thing, and they feel like doing 99 more things seems just so daunting and discouraging. But actually, you can only ever do one thing at a time. So the thing to focus on is the next thing. Maybe start by thinking “Do 5 things”, and when you get to 5, expand that to “Do 10 things”, and so on. Adjust the framework to make it work for you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-coercion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Some people try to bully and force themselves into doing 100 of something that they don’t want to do. I think this is mistaken. If part of you wants to do the thing, and part of you doesn’t, this is an opportunity for dialogue, negotiation, compromise. Get to know yourself better. It could be that you learn that you don’t really want to do the thing all that badly.

Think of all the negative words we have associated with a curious person: busybody, snoop, troublemaker, nosy parker. Even words like “inquisitive” tend to pick up negative connotations. I think part of this is because of complexity around privacy, which is understandable. Still, I think there is a tremendous opportunity for us to advance our species by encouraging curiosity at the most foundational layers, skillfully.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the early stages, curiosity can seem frivolous.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">That’s part of why it gets dismissed. It doesn’t obviously bear immediate fruit. It’s just some annoying kid asking irksome questions.

And I will admit it can also be a torment at times. It’s kept me going while writing this book, but it’s also refused to allow me to publish it until I feel that it’s really good. I’m just continually gripped by a desire to better understand the subject matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Encouraging curiosity has tremendous payoffs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Many people will casually pay lip service to curiosity, without really thinking about what it entails. If you ask them, “is curiosity good?” They will say, of course, yes! But in practice, curiosity can be really inconvenient. Curiosity is the sort of thing that makes people pack up their lives and move to the Amazon rainforest to study obscure butterflies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So some people might think it’s a little irresponsible of me to advocate for deliberately cultivating curiosity. But, oh well. There are worse things to advocate for.

Children seem to be pretty naturally curious. They might not all be curious about the same things. If you’ve ever spent a few hours watching kids free-roaming at a birthday party, you get to see how they each end up self-directed in different ways. I remember being amused recently by a child that really enjoyed going up to adults and talking to them – something I would never have done as a child myself. It really made it clear to me that every person is different, and has unique strengths and weaknesses, and how silly it is that we broadly act as if a couple of standards should work well for everyone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Anyway – the point of that is – don’t try to be curious about something you’re not curious about. This sounds a little silly but I do get DMs from people about this! They feel like they should be more curious about what their peers are into, or what is popular. That’s not how curiosity works. Curiosity is a cheeky mischief in your heart, a tingle in your fingers. If you pursue that feeling, genuinely, it will lead you on tremendous adventures, far beyond anything you can imagine.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">&quot;Questions are places in your mind where answers fit.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">If you haven&#39;t asked the question, the answer has nowhere to go.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">It hits your mind and bounces right off.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You have to ask the question – you have to want to know –</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">in order to open up space for the answer to fit.&quot;</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Clayton Christensen</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are two parts to this, the social aspect and the personal aspect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">People worry about embarrassing themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Socially, some people worry that questions will be interpreted in bad-faith, or will make them look bad – look ignorant, uninformed.

And my observation is – later in life, I get these kids in my DMs, and they ask me, <i>“How do I know what I want? How do I know if I’m okay? How do I know what matters to me?” </i>I actually started out writing this book trying to answer those questions directly, but only after agonizing over it for a couple of years did I begin to grasp that you don’t <i>go looking </i>for answers to those questions. The answers are already within you! You just need to reverse the invalidation. “Just”. Introspect is a book about trying to reverse self-invalidation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“If I get famous I’ll stop feeling lonely.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A depressing number of people pursue fame hoping that it’ll make them feel less lonely – and when they succeed, they often find that superstar fame is lonelier than anything else. People can pedestalize or demonize you, both of which are dehumanizing, and with potentially ruinous consequences. If you’re not careful, fame will crowd out the more intimate attention and understanding that you really want. Fame has its perks and upsides, but you want to be very careful when you’re courting it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Why can’t I sleep?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is a personal one for me. If there’s something you’ve been wanting to change about your life (eg: “fix my sleep”), and you’ve spent maybe 10+ years making failed attempts at it despite having done the reading, etc – the problem is probably upstream. It’s not actually the sleep, it’s something else. In my case, I’m coming around to realize that it’s not about whether I bring my phone to bed (I don’t) or sleep in a dark room (I do), but it’s about my conceptual relationship with rest altogether, which I will talk about in Act III.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Why am I so stupid?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’ve recurringly encountered people describing themselves as stupid, when they’re not. “It’s so stupid how I haven’t yet done the thing I know I’m supposed to do.” This is a misdiagnosis! The problem isn’t a lack of intelligence, but of courage. You aren’t an idiot, you’re a coward! And if you’re a coward who’s misdiagnosing yourself as an idiot, you’ll be stuck there indefinitely, working on the wrong problem! (Which, you could say, at a meta-level, is what your fear wants. It wants to work on the wrong problem.) Once you acknowledge that the problem is fear, you can take baby steps towards addressing it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“How do I become creative?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you think someone isn’t creative, you should look at their excuses. People are very, very good at coming up with all sorts of creative explanations for why they can’t do something. The</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">problem isn’t a lack of creativity. It’s typically a lack of courage, and sometimes a deficit of project management skills. You are already creative. The issue is likely that you’re clouding this from yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I don’t belong here.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A lot of people seem to think that imposter syndrome – the experience of feeling like you don’t belong, don’t deserve to be somewhere – is either a sign of actual moral failure (you’re a bad person), or it’s a sign of some psychological defect. That you’re feeling the wrong feelings, and you need to change how you feel. That’s <i>partially </i>correct, but it cannot be intellectually, solved by thinking. No amount of introspection will help you with a lack of knowledge about the interiority of others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You can only truly resolve your imposter syndrome by talking with other people, and getting to know about <i>their </i>experiences. The problem of feeling like a misfit is seeing for yourself firsthand how everyone else feels similarly. This requires getting out of your own head and giving a shit about other people’s experiences. The sense of belonging you seek is in your interactions with others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself– and you are the easiest person to fool.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">So you have to be very careful about that.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Richard Feynman, Nobel-winning physicist</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pretense of knowledge.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The big problem with problems, in my view, is that people <i>think </i>they understand the problems that they’re dealing with. If we openly began with the admission that we have no idea what we’re doing, no idea what we’re talking about, we will have a much easier time coming to good understandings of things. But unfortunately, we tend to have some expectations, some assumptions, some narrative, some idea about how things are “supposed” to be. And this can be a spanner in the works that grinds the whole enterprise to a halt. We can be stuck for years, decades, all our lives if we’re not careful – if we’re attached to a particular frame or point of view.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Complexity is difficult to wrangle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Another problem is that problems can be wicked, meaning they have many different factors. Boredom and procrastination are two everyday problems that people struggle with, I think, significantly because they are multivariate problems. There are several different things going wrong at once, and it takes effort to be clinical and precise in your thinking, so that you can tease apart the factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Happiness is not the absence of problems, it&#39;s the ability to deal with them.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Steve Maraboli</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Experiment with zooming out and zooming in to see the problem at different scales.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[Framing]].</span><span class="p"> The big and important thing to do is to begin by opening up as wide as you can, accepting the possibility that any problem that you’ve been dealing with for a long time may be framed wrongly.

Zoom in to look at the smallest possible facet of a problem. Instead of trying to solve “why am I unproductive”, which is a huge question that can take years to develop an understanding of, try solving “what would be a good use of 15 minutes of my time?” Now this isn’t to say that it isn’t worthwhile to ask the big question! I actually think it’s <i>excellent </i>to ask the big question. But pace yourself. Be careful that you aren’t hiding behind the big question to avoid facing simpler and more straightforward questions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exercise your imagination + seek novel inputs.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you don’t have a lot of practice using your imagination, your imagination might be limited and progress might be slow. A good “trick” here is to rely less on generating ideas from inside your own head, and instead take advantage of the chaotic nature of reality. Look for ideas from completely different domains than the one you’re operating. Grab a magazine or search around online for some interest that <i>isn’t </i>relevant to you. Watch a documentary about something you know nothing about. Take a random bus in a random direction. Go somewhere different. Eat something different. Surprise yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Write down precisely what you think the problem is, and what the factors are.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[Journal]].</span><span class="p"> It’s very, very difficult to solve multi-factor problems in your head, or to identify errors in your thinking. Have you ever noticed how other people are so wrong about so many things? If you write stuff down, and revisit it, you can notice this about yourself, too.

My friend Malcolm Ocean (@malcolm_ocean) has a great riff where he points at something that’s less-than-great, and asks, “What if it were good, though?” How can we reframe this in a way that is useful, good, interesting, helpful? What would it look like if it were good?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You don’t need to answer every single question that you ask. Sometimes you make a list of a dozen questions, and one of them seizes your attention – it excites you, tantalizes you with the promise of an interesting journey. That’s the one I’d pick. Even if it isn’t necessarily the “most useful” – I think at a meta-level it’s good to get in the habit of <i>enjoying your life. </i>You’re much likelier to stick with something if you’re having fun.

But when you have a dream, it doesn’t often come at you screaming in your face, “This is who you are, this is what you must be for the rest of your life.” Sometimes a dream almost whispers. And I’ve always said to my kids, the hardest thing to listen to—your instincts, your human personal intuition—always whispers; it never shouts. Very hard to hear. So you have to every day of your lives be ready to hear what whispers in your ear; it very rarely shouts. And if you can listen to the whisper, and </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">if it tickles your heart</span><span class="s22">, and it’s something you think you want to do for the rest of your life, then that is going to be what you do for the rest of your life, and we will benefit from everything you do.”</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Steven Spielberg, speech at the Academy of Achievement</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Practice articulating what you want.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When I was a teenager, I badly wanted to be a rockstar. This wasn’t a childhood dream, I didn’t really know about rockstars as a kid. My family wasn’t musical. Michael Jackson was the major star of the world of my childhood, but I didn’t really care for him. I do enjoy his songs, and respect his style and skill, but he didn’t set my heart alight. Looking back, I think it’s because I thought he was very “polite” and “safe”. Which already tells me something important about myself: I’m not very interested in “polite” and “safe”. (Re-reading this now, I also realize that a lot of this was about me crossing the threshold from childhood to adolescence – “rockstar” was the frame I was using to express my independence, my rebellion, my sexuality.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I remember getting into Metallica and Guns N’ Roses as a teenager, and Radiohead, and Disturbed, and what I think I enjoyed about all of those bands is that they felt a little subversive, dangerous. And that’s what drew me in. I had a few peers who played musical instruments, and I thought they were really cool, and I wanted to hang out with them, and so I taught myself the guitar, and the bass – which I thought was the easiest instrument for a person with no musical background to pick up. I jammed with several bands, started a couple of my own, organized my own concerts, and all in all it was a fantastic part of my adolescence. I learned so much about life from those days, far more than anything I learned in school.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I still love music, though I do feel like I don’t love it as wholeheartedly as some “real” musicians I’ve met. I’ve met musicians who truly lived and breathed music, who woke up in the morning wanting to play music, and would practice their instrument until bed. I didn’t love music <i>that </i>much. That too taught me something important about myself. (What I do love that much is language. Words. I can nerd out about words indefinitely, all day everyday. Which is why I’m writing books instead of albums.)</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Disassemble your desires</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Anyway, the point of all of that is to lead up to this little diagram I once put together when trying to make sense of myself. Somebody on Twitter once asked, “what’s your biggest unfulfilled dream?” And the obvious response that arose for me was “touring rock musician” – I explicitly remember that I used to fantasize about running away from home and going on the road with nothing but a guitar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I asked myself, “What are the things I hoped to get out of inhabiting that role?” And I wrote them down:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="622" height="283" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_045.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">While I never did end up becoming one (and never say never! I’m still young!), I’ve found it very fulfilling to deconstruct all of the things I would&#39;ve wanted to get out of it, and then restructure my life to get each of those bits from different sources. So at this point in my life, even though I’m not actually on the road, I do actually <i>feel </i>like a touring rock musician – or what I imagined it would be like to be a touring rock musician. I highly recommend doing this with your &quot;unfulfilled&quot; dreams. (Also, I feel like it’s important to note that reality is always muckier that we imagine it to be. Actually being a touring musician must be exhausting. Being on the road, sleeping in different places, eating different foods… exciting in some ways, but also exhausting for sure.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Back to Disassembling: you can do this with everything. Maybe you think you want to get rich, but it turns out that... what you want is the $$ so you can buy really good food. If so, maybe you can become a home chef, or a food critic! Trying to solve problems with money is often the least intelligent solution. And the reason we go with the least intelligent solution, I think, is that we have gotten so numb to our own feelings, we dull our own sensitivity and our imagination.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s usually a better way, and that’s something to be excited and curious about. Reframe. Remix. Mess around.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be sensitive to inherited wants</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think in a section about desires, it’ll also be useful to talk a bit about when I was wrong about what I wanted. The first example that comes to mind is: I used to have a bunch of books that I bought and kept, because I wanted to be the kind of person who read them. Books about philosophy and science that seemed like they were really smart and important. The Origin of Species! The Illiad! But I didn’t <i>actually </i>want to read them at the time. I mostly just wanted to be impressive, prestigious, cultured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I don’t think it’s entirely bad to want to be impressive to others. After all, we are social creatures, so the impulse to impress is an entirely natural one. I think the important thing is to <i>be honest with ourselves about it</i>. Do not <i>pretend </i>to be interested in something, hoping that faking your interest in it will eventually lead to genuine interest. But this can be tricky. I’ll get into another example shortly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Walk and then pave the desire paths</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="512" height="288" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A concept that I encountered fairly late that really grew on me over the years is the idea of a desire path. A desire path is a path that’s created by people walking over it repeatedly. These paths tend to be really efficient, and have a beautiful elegance to them that’s quite a bit different than the sterile grids that we tend to come up with when we try to plan things in a top-down way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s funny – part of what annoys me about the present state of the book you’re reading right now is that I didn’t have enough time to really write it the way I wanted it. It looks more like New York than Paris. The act of writing it has made it clearer to me what the next version of the book might look like, but I don’t have the time or energy to redo the whole thing from scratch all over again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="539" height="283" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But anyway, the point of bringing up the concept is: you can pave the desire paths in your own life. Just do little things that you want. Do lots of little random things and pay attention to how you feel about it. And then work with that. A lightbulb moment I had recently while editing this book is that you don’t actually need to “Know” what you want, in order to do what you want.</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Children certainly don’t! They just do what they want! The problem is that we get inside our own heads. We force ourselves to justify ourselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“I don&#39;t want whatever I want. Nobody does. Not really. What kind of fun would it be if I just got everything I ever wanted just like that, and it didn&#39;t mean anything?</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">What then?”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Neil Gaiman, Coraline</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The above quote is quite cynical and a little dissonant from the theme of the overarching optimism of this book, but I feel like including it anyway. The perspective here is the idea that nobody actually wants what they want, and that they enjoy the wanting. Do I agree with that? I think it’s sometimes true for some people, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. My instinct is that this is the perspective of an unintegrated person, someone who is internally haunted or tormented in some way. “Nobody does” is a minor “tell”. How can anybody assume what is true for everybody else? I can’t be <i>sure </i>that the character is projecting, but it does rhyme with what people who are projecting do. Like how dishonest people assume that everyone else is dishonest, too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I believe it’s possible to get to a state where you want what you want, and you do enjoy getting what you want, and it does mean something to you, and after you get what you want, you move on to wanting new and different things, in a way that is additive, wholesome, nourishing rather than empty and tasteless like how the “hedonic treadmill” feels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But I also do remember what it was like, in the depths of my depression, to feel like everything is bullshit, wants are all fake, just chemicals in your brain fucking with you, because we’re all a meaningless accident of evolution, yadda yadda. I do remember that. It was really bleak. What would I say to my younger self? I wouldn’t argue with him. Because he’s not wrong! His misery is in fact quite significantly a consequence of him being “not wrong”. The challenge is to invite him to experiment with different ways of being, for the heck of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“How do I tell the difference between what I actually want, and what I think I want?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">As I mentioned earlier when talking about sovereignty, people tend to be unsure of themselves, possibly because of all of the conditioning, all of the fog. So this is like saying, fogs be foggy!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The social aspect is really tough. For example, coming to terms with the fact that you mostly like something because you like <i>someone</i>. Sometimes this leads to a genuine thing, sometimes it doesn’t, and you’re the only person who can really know for sure. It can be smart to seek out a “networked answer”, where you try and talk with lots of different people to see how your feelings change when you’re in the presence of different people. You can also do this by journaling repeatedly over an extended period of time. We’ll get into this in greater detail in the next Act.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s69">// There’s some stuff I’d like to get into here about Girardian or mimetic desire, but I don’t have time.

I do want to caution, though, that in both cases, you should never really take any one person’s word as gospel truth about who you are. Because they don’t necessarily see you “for who you are”, they see you through their own lens, which is colored by their own struggles, their own life experience. It’s best to “triangulate” a sense of how you are perceived, by talking to a wide range of people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Soften the ground.” – make your own desire paths!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Sometimes there’s something that you do want, and yet it’s not quite… right. An example that comes to mind for me: I vaguely knew that I wanted to know more about jazz, and Miles Davis. As a musician, this seemed normal and right for me. And yet I kept procrastinating. I think</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">sometime around 2015 I started listening to <i>Kind of Blue </i>on repeat on YouTube – and that softened the ground a little bit for me. Now I wanna know more about the guy who made the thing I like.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But that wasn’t enough yet to make me want to watch a 2 hour documentary. Until, at some point, I found myself asking the question, “What was the scene that Miles played in, anyway? What was that like?” – because I’ve had this ongoing curiosity about scenes. That led to me reading his Wikipedia page with some interest, and some of the details jumped out at me enough to get me interested in watching documentaries. Do you see what happened here? I had a vague intellectual interest, and I kept it around until I found an entry point that “softened the ground” for me – something which I think might be more in the realm of emotions. This is a skill you can develop!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deﬁne your dream life in as much detail as you can manage.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Put together vision boards on Pinterest. Make collections of your favorite objects. Make lists of your favorite quotes. This stuff might seem frivolous but it’s very, very powerful. Yes, this is kind of in “Law of Attraction” or “The Secret” territory. I haven’t read that stuff too deeply – I think some of the criticisms of those ideas are that the language is very wooey, with claims like “The Universe will provide!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Personally, I choose to read such statements as poetic, mythic ideas, rather than literal truths. That way I find a way to make the ideas useful to me, without necessarily buying into a broader ideology or worldview. There’s a quote I remember from an interview with Machine Gun Kelly, where he said something like (I paraphrase), “Suppose The Universe wanted to give a spaceship to someone. It could give it to some random kid, or it could give it to that weirdo who’s wearing a spacesuit to school every day. I was the kid wearing a spacesuit.” Again, I think there’s something to that, even if I don’t particularly think of “The Universe” as some sort of divine consciousness or agentic being. It can be a proxy for “social forces beyond your awareness”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Optimize for the serendipity that you want.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Another way of thinking about all of this is that it’s about optimizing for serendipity that you want. Optimizing for luck. Making yourself receptive, being prepared for opportunities. Something like this happened for me not too long ago. I have a habit of doing Twitter threads about books I’m reading. I’ve also been making videos on my YouTube channel, chatting with friends and so on. One day, I did a book thread about David Deutsch’s Beginning of Infinity. Great book. Turns out I happened to have a mutual friend with David, and he was interested in doing a video chat with me about the book! I’ve had multiple opportunities like this over the years. Sure, it’s possible that I’m just very lucky. But I’ve found that I tend to get a lot luckier when I put myself in places where there are high rates of interaction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s52" style=" background-color: #424242;">Investigate your desires:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Children don’t seem to spend much time agonizing about their desires.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 229%;text-align: center;">They know what they want.

What has helped me – which is kind of annoying, but it works – is to see that my aversion to asking for help prevents me from helping others in turn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Which is to say, </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">it’s actually selfish of me </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">not </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">to ask for help!</span><span class="p"> Because my attempt to protect my own ego is the bottleneck limiting me from doing more good in the world!

Remember, a </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[project]]</span><span class="p"> is anything that requires collaboration, even if only with yourself. Collaboration is deeply humanizing, and the inability to collaborate is therefore dehumanizing. Asking for help is about seeking collaboration, you want someone to labor with you. Being unable to ask for help is dehumanizing. And I’ve felt this myself, very recently, in the process of writing this book, and feeling like I was doing it in a deep, dark pit all by my lonesome. </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[jailbreak]].</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And it was entirely self-imposed. Because I <i>know </i>that I have friends who love me, care about me, and would be delighted to have the opportunity to assist me with literally anything that I ask them for. So the interesting thing for <i>me </i>to introspect on is, why? Why did I refuse free help?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Not only would it have been free, it would have made my friends happy, and it would have saved me time, so it would have been a win-win!

My inner </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[authoritarian-tyrant]]</span><span class="p"> was adamant that I had to work on this book all by myself or “it would be fake bullshit”, it “wouldn’t count”.

People are afraid of judgment and criticism. They’re afraid of being vulnerable, of being perceived as weak, and mocked for that weakness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And they may have participated in the mockery of others for being weak. If you’ve done that, it can make it even harder to ask for help, because deep down you now know that it’s only “just and proper” that you be mocked in turn. Why do you deserve mercy if you didn’t show mercy to others? So if you want to seek help, I think it’s very important that you personally commit to never mocking anyone else for asking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Here’s a little anecdote of a behavior pattern I had back when I used to have a proper job, working in a team that had deadlines and so on. I can talk about it quite openly now, but at the time it was strange. And actually, when I think about it, there are versions of this pattern still playing out today. Anyway the thing is: I would be running late on a task, and then I would freeze up and “go dark”. My colleagues would message me, fairly casually asking, “Yo, Visa, what’s the latest on this? Any update?” I would see it, and my blood would run cold. I’m not exaggerating. I would freeze and panic and try to desperately finish whatever it was that I owed, even though realistically it wasn’t going to happen anytime soon. And I would basically be in a state of alarm and anxiety the whole time. While being in denial about the whole thing, because of course I’m not an anxious guy, what are you talking about! =p</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I did have conversations with my colleagues about this, bless them, they were really understanding and supportive. They would remind me that, dude, it’s way better for everyone if you just keep everyone posted on the progress at regular intervals, so people know what to expect, what to plan. When in doubt, overcommunicate</span><span class="s14">. </span><span class="p">This made sense to me intellectually, but it felt utterly revulsive in my body. Even now, typing this, I can feel my mouth going dry, and my stomach is churning a little bit. I realize now that this goes back to childhood shit with family and school. That almost every single interaction I had in this kind of domain just led to me getting punished for it, and that the best way to avoid punishments was to try to hide. And so this is something that I have to actively repattern, process, confront.

[...] No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it. What underpinned this shame, this &quot;I&#39;m not good enough,&quot; -- which, we all know that feeling: &quot;I&#39;m not blank enough. I&#39;m not thin enough, rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough.&quot; The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability. This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it.

Try to write in as much detail as possible. Ask yourself questions. “I need more money” – Why? For what? What is the outcome that you want?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s69" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">// The following is extracted from a blogpost I’ve written.

Why should this person help you? What is it like to receive a message from you? Don’t be a creep. Don’t be a bore. If it’s an important text or email, and you’re not sure of yourself, run it by a trusted friend. Read it out loud and feel how it sounds. It shouldn’t sound like a demand, a threat or a hostage letter. It should sound, ideally, like a casual invite to a bit of fun.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Keep it short.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If you need help from someone, don’t make them read an essay just to understand what you’re asking. Put in the effort to edit down your request until it’s something that’s quick and easy to read. You might have 10 questions for them. Put 9 of them in your drafts, and ask the most important one. The more work you make them have to do to help you, the worse your odds of getting help get.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Give a sincere, speciﬁc compliment<span class="s71">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’m not saying appeal to their ego to make them feel good, though that doesn’t hurt. The important thing is to demonstrate that you’ve done your homework. “I read your essay about X and I thought it was really insightful how you talked about Y.” Giving people specific, sincere compliments is a gift, and it will make them feel like repaying the kindness – if your request is a reasonable one. You’re no longer “random stranger”, you’re “person who appreciates my work”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Make it easy for them to say yes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Don’t give them the <i>total </i>responsibility of figuring out what kind of help you need. Make an effort to describe your issue in detail. Nobody wants additional responsibility for no clear reward or payoff. We all have enough responsibilities already.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Do your homework.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Do at least a cursory check to see if they’ve already answered the question that you’re asking. Google your question and see what the top results are, and read through the results. Piece together *your* tentative answer to the question you’re asking. Eg, instead of simply asking “should I do X or Y”, it’s worth adding a line that says, “I read a compelling argument for X, but…”. This lengthens your message slightly (don’t write a whole essay), but it’s worth it because it demonstrates that you’re serious and not just screwing around.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">Don’t be needy and/or demanding<span class="s71">.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Nobody owes you a response. It’s sad that this needs to be said, and yet it does. But also, a lighter version of this: don’t be tedious about how “you’re probably not going to see this…” and “I don’t expect a reply…” or any of that stuff. Just ask your question and go. The more overwrought you make things, the weirder you make it for them. Just ask the question, in a breezy and relaxed tone if you can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">[/blogpost stuff]</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Appreciate the fact that there are many kinds of people in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Not everybody will want to help, but not everybody will want to mock you either.

The comedian’s job is to remind us that it’s all hilarious. And not in a contemptuous or cruel way – laughing at ourselves should be wholesome, nourishing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So anyway, y’know. I get pretty bummed out when I see comedians get all tangled up in stupid non-discussions about people being offended and whatnot. It’s like finding out that they’re not really comedians, only pretending to be, only playing the part of it. I was rooting for you!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But I can’t be too mad about it because that would be me missing the plot too, you see what I mean? It’s a little lonely inhabiting this space because very few people seem to really get it all</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">the way through. But the joke there is, “That’s my secret, Captain – I’m always lonely.” <span class="s53">😂 </span>If I can laugh about my solitude, heartily, it ceases to have a vise-grip hold on me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You can’t prescribe this as a method to anybody else, because it can be reductive and dismissive if it’s done without love. But for me privately, “what’s the joke here” gets me through almost everything. Laughter is not just medicine, it is a radical act in an anxious universe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s been a while since I read Nassim Taleb, but one of my favorite bits from him is when he mentioned fantasizing about putting a mouse down the shirts of stiff corporate suit types. In a way that’s a great way to describe all of this. Put the mouse of joy down your own suit. I also just remembered that one of my favorite comics of all time uses a rodent as a cheeky way of breaking through solemnity. There is something profound here. Lots of people imprison their mischievous trickster rat, and in so doing imprison themselves. Humor is a critical part of breaking the rigid frame of joyless tyranny.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A lot of paradoxes might be best resolved with a sense of humor.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For example, dicking around can be productive, but if you&#39;re anxious about <i>being </i>productive, that typically ruins the whole thing. The conflict creates a vortex that can be anxiety-inducing, until you see the humor in it. Once you can laugh about the ridiculousness of it all, you can steer your ship between the extremes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is the heart of philosophy, all else is commentary:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="613" height="353" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_050.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I have a pretty long list of such “ayy lmao” memes, where seeing the humor of the tension between two opposites helps to navigate it better.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">reality — fantasy nobility — savagery</p><p style="padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">passive indolence — neurotic busyness absolutely Pointless — critically important immutable will of the divine — what I want, gosh everything is my fault — nothing is anybody’s fault everything is magick — nothing is magick cynicism imprisons — naivete burns</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">cloying, abject tenderness — brittle, rigid toughness</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In every case, going too far in either extreme is potentially destructive – and yet it’s very challenging to have a “perfect balance” in between. The balance is less about striving for a 50/50 split in every moment, but rather, learning which frame is best for each context. And the humor <i>here </i>is, there’s no way we can ever become wise enough to know. So we’re always going to get our asses kicked, no matter how wise we are, and especially if we think we’re too wise to be “caught by surprise”. Life is fundamentally full of surprises. That’s the joke!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Joke about the outcomes you want</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is a section about memeing things into existence. The stuff you joke about – even “ironically” – has a way of shaping your reality, so be careful and deliberate with that stuff. A lot of people fumble their own bags by joking about outcomes they don’t want. You might as well joke about the outcomes you do want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I used to joke about being broke, and I started making more money when I decided that I wasn’t gonna do that anymore. I have a t-shirt business that I run on the side, and I literally made a</p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">t-shirt that said “BO LUI”, which is Hokkien for “no money”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="586" height="383" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_051.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When a person talks about what they want, I can take actions that might help them get what they want.

When we complain we are inviting others to complain with us and help us complain more.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you spend your time and energy focusing on what you don’t want, you’ll likely end up getting more of it. For example, there’s a subreddit called /r/EnoughPetersonSpam where people post all day about how they can’t stand seeing anything about Jordan Peterson. And then they seem legitimately shocked when Reddit suggests to them that, maybe, if they’re in a subreddit that talks about Jordan Peterson, they might be interested in Jordan Peterson?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="417" height="417" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_052.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is how the world works, friends!

It’s full of struggle, pain, injustice, cruelty. And they’re right. There’s genuinely a lot to be miserable about. We shouldn’t hide away from this, or deny it. There is a truth to that, but it’s not the whole truth. The right thing to do is very</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">context-dependent.

This can be useful to some degree as a coping mechanism, but I recommend that you be careful not to let this become too much of a habit. It’s tricky stuff! It can take many years to figure out what the balance is, and the act of finding this balance will likely involve making mistakes, sometimes painful mistakes that can be socially costly. That’s unfortunately part of the game. The good thing is that you can get better at it, and reduce your “error rate”. The frustrating thing is that, because of the bandwidth limitations of conversation, you can almost never completely prevent errors, except by refusing to communicate with anybody altogether.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;"><span class="s22">“Humor is the touchstone of the truly mythological as distinct from the more literal-minded and sentimental theological mood.

Set aside some time for laughter. I particularly recommend going on YouTube and listening to Alan Watts – who might not be an obvious comedian. He described himself I think as a “spiritual entertainer”, because he liked to talk about life and death and identity and the self and so on – but to me it’s really important that he had such a cheeky, mischievous trickster energy.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ask, in the cheekiest voice you can muster, ”So what?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">(This is a tricky one because it depends on the context and delivery, so if you’re not feeling it, just ignore it. But if it hits you in the right way, it can be a tremendous relief.) A lot of the problem a lot of the time is that people have some implicit assumption that they’re not articulating. They think “God I’m so stupid, I’m such a failure”, and they feel bad about it, because implicitly they think “being stupid is bad, I cannot be loved or accepted or worthy if I’m stupid”. And the question to ask is, so what? So what if you’re stupid? What if being stupid is fine, actually? What next? Then what? And the thing here is not to be antagonistic, but genuine.

This simple thing altered my view of reality. Victor intentionally played notes that, theoretically speaking, are “off” and “wrong”. He was making “mistakes” on purpose. But because of that purposefulness, he was able to make it sound musical. Every note felt intentional and correct, even in its “wrongness”.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s73" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1415492918228307970" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank">This completely shifted my understanding of music, and my understanding of mistakes as well. </a><a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1415492918228307970" class="a" target="_blank">Jacob Collier made a similar point</a> <span style=" color: #000;">by demonstrating how notes that sound wrong in one instance, can be resolved in another.

We flinch at mistakes instead of seeing them as opportunities to be explored. I’ve since found in my music practice that “mistakes” actually add color and flavor to my playing, if instead of flinching at them, I “invite them in”, and welcome them, and make friends with them. And even more radically, I found that once I became more accepting of mistakes, my playing started to improve dramatically. I had been stuck in a musical rut for almost a decade because I was afraid of leaving my comfort zone, afraid of “wrong” sounds, afraid to allow my fingers to explore and learn. In the past, whenever my fingers did something they weren’t “supposed” to, I would internally flinch, lightly berate myself, “ugh”, “shit”, “ick”. But now I try to think “ooh!” and I look for ways to work around it, return to it, build off of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And the result has been tremendous for me – even a little bit of freedom from judgment has given me room to explore and learn. Once I stopped being some sort of authoritarian taskmaster over myself, insisting that the music had to be a certain way, I found that a whole new world of delicious interestingness opened up, and I found my hands and ears and body delighted to really explore and feel all kinds of sounds, good and bad, and understand them as well as possible.

That&#39;s the power of negative thinking.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Cmdr.

There are two episodes of really bad depression that I’ve had that I sometimes talk about – once when I was about 17, and again when I was about 25. Those were the two times I remember seriously considering killing myself. The first time, at 17, I kept going out of literal rage. I refused to accept defeat. I had read widely enough to know that life is long and things can turn around and that what happens in school doesn’t have to define you in the slightest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="418" height="367" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_055.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">At 25, I felt much more empty and resigned. I felt less like I was trapped by social expectations from family, teachers, etc, and more like I was trapped by the drudgery of life itself. It’s hard to disentangle how much of this was, say, a consequence of bills, versus existential despair (I don’t think this was <i>that </i>big a deal, I had a lot of experience thinking through that stuff when I was</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">about 19 thru 22…). The bills were a big part of it, but the bigger part I think was the way I was thinking about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s interesting now to look back and try to make sense of what’s happening. I don’t actually have the time to fully get into it and give it the thorough treatment I want to in this version of the book</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">– that’ll require me to reread and reevaluate old journal entries to really get a sense of what I was thinking then. So I’ll go with my memory, which is likely distorted by hindsight. In the depths of my depression it felt like I didn’t have any optimism in the tank, moment-to-moment. I remember life feeling absolutely bleak. But… somehow I persisted through it, which suggests to me that there was <i>something</i>. And if I had to guess what that something was, I think it was the belief that things <i>could </i>get better in the future. Where did that belief come from?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">As I’ve said earlier, I believe it came from music, and literature, and art. I knew that I wasn’t the first person to suffer what I was suffering. And I knew of people who had at least theoretically made it through depressive episodes. And I dared to believe that I could be one of them too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Alright, now I feel like I should talk about optimism proper. It might seem contradictory after talking about depression, but all my life, people have described me as optimistic, to the point of calling me naive. I personally wear naivete as a badge of honor. In my experience, naivete will burn you, but cynicism will imprison you. (see: ayy lmao meme in 2.11).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Q: Is optimism a matter of innate temperament, personality?</p><p style="padding-top: 19pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Maybe to some degree this is a matter of disposition. I don’t know if I really believe that. I do think that people who don’t believe in disposition are likelier to be able to subvert it. Or maybe that runs the other way around, maybe people who are able to subvert their dispositions are less likely to believe in them as static.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I do believe that personality is fundamentally fluid to a degree that most people don’t believe. Most people tend to seek out familiar contexts, and so they never even really get to find out who they are outside of those contexts, meaning they end up conflating their contexts and their “selves”. This stuff is very complex and I could write a whole novel about the nuance here. (I might do that, actually.) But for now let’s say this is beyond the scope of this book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &quot;Look for the helpers.

I agonized over this as a teenager. Turns out the agony isn’t actually necessary. What you need to do is revert to very small baby steps. The hard part here typically is that the ego is in the way.

If we never take the time to step away from it all to reflect on what we want, it’s very easy to get nudged into a life that we did not choose for ourselves.

To dismantle them, the important thing is to really investigate them honestly and to see what needs they are meeting. Do a root-cause analysis and to seek upstream solutions. This can be a tiresome and iterative process, where you may repeatedly find that there&#39;s something else further upstream. Still, progress can be made, and should be celebrated. A critical thing will be to reconceptualize your relationship(s) with your coping mechanisms altogether (Easyway).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: -19pt;text-align: left;">Face your anger</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There is a wisdom in your anger. It is trying to protect you. It is a clue to the injustices and cruelties you have endured. It might be either suppressed or overblown. The challenge is to listen to it, and to express it appropriately, skillfully. Unfortunately, we live in a world that isn’t very good at dealing with anger, so it might be unwise to express it too openly, too publicly before you are skilled at it. But you can cultivate that skill.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Avoid exhaustion funnels</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I&#39;ve always struggled with this one myself: you can&#39;t skimp on rest. If you don&#39;t schedule time for rest and recovery, it will be scheduled for you, at the most inopportune of times. What&#39;s difficult is zooming out to see the bigger picture. You&#39;re not doing anybody any favors if you&#39;re exhausted, and once you&#39;re exhausted, it messes with your perception, and you make worse decisions. perpetual exhaustion is not very different than perpetual drunkenness. There are some tips and tactics, but the critical thing is to reconceptualize your relationship with rest entirely.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s76" style=" background-color: #424242;"> </span><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">3.1 Investigate your boredom</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“The cure for boredom is curiosity.

I’m talking about a deeper, corrosive boredom, more akin to malaise (ill-ease) or ennui, the kind that’s heavy, haunting, foreboding.

Which, in my opinion, are usually the real underlying issues that people are avoiding.

We don&#39;t need to fixate on the losing frames, we can focus on the winning frames instead.

I love it. It’s kind of dramatic, and I wouldn’t say that I necessarily endorse it entirely, but I really love this sort of big-picture framework, how it contextualizes everything within a larger view:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="617" height="401" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_061.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Demonic Boredom” is such a great phrase! And I really like the parallels to “future anxiety” and “past guilt” – all of these are things that I think we can take some time to consider, evaluate, process and integrate. I don’t really believe in trying to get <i>rid </i>of guilt, anxiety or boredom by avoiding them (although maybe if your system is broken, it might be helpful to have some coping mechanisms – more on that later). I believe that they are <i>signals</i>, they are trying to tell us that something isn’t right, and it’s up to us whether we want to undertake the project(s) of identifying and addressing the underlying issues.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Resolving boredom can require self-annihilation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Fun fact: This entire book actually started out as “how do I not be (demonically) bored?” And the answer to that question ended up far more tremendous than I expected. I found that, to address your boredom you have to address your desires, and to address your desires you have to investigate your self-concept, and to investigate your self-concept is – not to be too dramatic about it – to annihilate yourself. Because the self is a story that we tell ourselves, and when we investigate that story we discover that it’s dynamic, not static, and once we do that we’re never the same again. At the end of self-annihilation is renewal and rebirth, and when you get there you kinda forget what you were bored about in the first place. Sometimes you pull a little thread because you&#39;re bored and you accidentally unravel the universe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Coming back to Earth, I think boredom is experienced as the feeling of “Ugh, there’s nothing to do!” It might not be a <i>literal </i>truth. There’s obviously always things to do. But I think people say it because it’s the <i>felt </i>truth of their experience. It <i>feels </i>like there’s nothing to do. And really sitting with that feeling, really investigating it, it turns out, is not only the key to solving your boredom – it’s the key to everything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“When our emotional intelligence is restricted, we often do not know what we really want, and can consequently struggle mightily</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">with even the smallest decisions.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Pete Walker, psychotherapist</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Energy levels too low.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[Exhaustion funnels.]]</span><span class="p"> If you’re really, truly exhausted and you can’t do anything, you should shut off and rest.

This is a conceptualization problem (re: our relationship with rest), and buried in that is an emotional problem. It’s a question of “deserve”. Who deserves rest?

Still, I must really emphasize that this is absolutely not my area of expertise. Sometimes I feel like I only just began to get in touch with my own body for the first time in my 30s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seek to be a native of your body, rather than an unwanted houseguest.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think one of the wildest things about life is how things that you don&#39;t think of having any relation to your body, can affect your body.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I mean, everything ultimately affects your body, but – for example, my body has definitely been doused with cortisol and adrenaline the past 3-4 days or so because of family commitments and an approaching (self-imposed) deadline. I can feel it in my shoulders and stomach and I can also feel it in more subtle and nuanced ways these days – The body not only keeps the score, it’s effectively a sort of living memory palace once you start to learn how to read it. I mean it always was, but we’re kinda trained to disregard, disconnect, disembody…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Breathing can make you feel warm and fuzzy and welcome.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I feel like nobody ever sold meditation to me the way it I believe ought to have been pitched. The body is a sort of bustling metropolis, and to me meditation (which I approach as breathwork, really) is really about learning to make sense of it. As a native rather than as a tourist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The body is full of inside jokes and private grievances that it hides from the cops, the feds, the adults, the squares (the consciousness). It’s actually pretty sad when you really get into it. It’s all connected. The tyrannical fascism of mind over body is pretty bleak. “The worst violence is that which we inflict upon ourselves”. If you don’t listen to yourself how do you really listen to anybody else?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stretching can make you feel limber like a child again.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I similarly feel like nobody has ever sold me <i>stretching </i>the way it ought to have been pitched. I was under the impression that it’s something you kinda begrudgingly do so that you don’t get injured when working out. I now realize that it’s a way of becoming more limber, flexible, and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">that physical flexibility is something that can make you feel like a child again. In some ways, I feel more child-like at 31 than I did throughout my stiff 20s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The body has an intelligence of its own that seems to be “pre-conscious”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When you touch a hot stove, for example, your body immediately pulls away before you even have time to think. When you’re staring into space thinking about something, and an attractive person walks past, there’s a good chance that you find yourself looking at them before you realize that you made that decision.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There are also ways we talk that reveal a broader understanding of the role of the body. We say things like “half-hearted”, or “my heart wasn’t in it”, or “I haven’t the heart to”. We talk about gut instinct, and a sinking feeling in the stomach.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I believe that the ancient Greeks believed that courage, or spirit, was something that resided in the chest. And even today our gestures seem to corroborate with this – notice how often athletes thump their chests in victory, and how often we put our hands to our hearts when we feel honored. I don’t know enough to speak confidently about this in detail, but I can say I’m pretty sure there’s <i>something </i>here. The body language of triumph is unmistakable:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="472" height="214" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_062.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And so too is the body language of disappointment, fear, defeat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="543" height="310" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_063.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I share these examples to gesture at the fact that your body is always telling you (and everyone else around you) something about your inner state. This is a <i>language</i>, and it is a language you can learn to get better at. And since you’re going to be inhabiting your body for as long as you’re alive, it makes a lot of sense to get good at it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="p">In the next section we will talk about </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[facing your fears]]</span><span class="p">, and that’s a very “bodily” experience.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Trauma lives in the body. It is somatic. The body keeps the score. And so the only way to move past our stuff, past our trauma, is to have an experience of Inverse PTSD. An experience that is equally profound and equally impacting. But it is the inverse of the initial trauma. Instead of being horrific, it is beatific. It awakens and unleashes the free, brave, reckless god that lives inside us. An experience of such radiance, not just in the mind, but also in the heart and the body. It kind of leads to fear extinction and memory reconsolidation. All is refreshed, and renewed, and reborn.” – Jason Silva</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Everybody is struggling with different things. Some people have stiffness and soreness in their muscles from carrying tension in them all the time. Stress and anxiety is manifest in the body.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following is an illustration from <i>The Body Keeps The Score</i>:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="624" height="460" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_064.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Trauma affects the entire human organism – body, mind and brain. In PTSD the body continues to defend against a threat that belongs to the past. Healing from PTSD means being able to terminate this continued stress mobilization and restore the entire organism to safety.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This illustration stopped me in my tracks when I first encountered it. I found it to be a very sobering reminder that the body and mind are deeply interconnected. Stress isn’t something that just happens inside your skull. It wrenches your muscles, beats your heart, and it can give you the shits. Simply stopping to really appreciate this fact, I think, can be life-changing for some people. To realize that what you’re thinking in your head, and what’s happening in your body, are not two separate things. The aches and pains in your body are not random events like the weather – they are actually <i>intertwined </i>with whatever is going on in your mind.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Fear next turns fully to your body, which is already aware that something terribly wrong is going on. Already your lungs have flown away like a bird and your guts have slithered away like a snake. Now your tongue drops dead like an opossum, while your jaw begins to gallop on the spot. Your ears go deaf. Your muscles begin to shiver as if they had malaria and your knees to shake as though they were dancing. Your heart strains too hard, while your sphincter relaxes too much.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">And so with the rest of your body. Every part of you, in the manner most suited to it, falls apart. Only your eyes work well. They always pay proper attention to fear.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Yann Martell, Life of Pi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Overthinking.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Some people are very cerebral, intellectual types. Sir Ken Robinson has a funny joke about this, how academics think of their bodies as vehicles for their heads. This can result in some funny “abstraction leaks”, an innocuous example being something like somebody who’s so focused on their work that they forget to eat and gets light-headed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It can get quite a bit more sinister, like suppressing emotions without realizing that that’s what they’re doing, and then experiencing seemingly unrelated consequences – aches and pains, stomach ailments, fatigue, and so on. A very interesting thing to me is how people struggling with some persistent problem tend to have a self-shadowing blind spot about it. People who are struggling with their diet tend to underestimate how much they eat – often they have secret binge snacks. People who struggle with their spending tend to similarly underestimate how much they spend. People who struggle with sleep tend to say “I can’t sleep”, even though that’s objectively false.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trauma.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This book isn’t specifically about trauma, because I don’t feel qualified to talk about that directly. But it’s a thing that crops up. “Trauma” can seem like a dramatic word, and I think sometimes people skim past it thinking “well, I wasn’t abused as a child or anything like that, so trauma has nothing to do with me”. I think that’s unfortunate, because there’s something in the literature for everybody. Everybody has some issues, because everybody is human. Everybody has some pain, some disappointment, <i>some </i>shit that they’re avoiding or averse to. It might not be as bad as how other people have it, but it can still be something that inhibits your emotions, freezes up your body, even in little, subtle ways.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-consciousness.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Different people have widely different relationships with their bodies. Some people have really bad body image issues, feel guilt and shame about eating, about being too skinny, too fat, and feel like their bodies are battlegrounds on which moral wars are waged, in which they’re typically on the losing side.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">&quot;In order to change, people need to become aware of their sensations and the way that their bodies interact with the world around them.

I didn’t seriously start doing breathwork until my late 20s, and I feel really silly that it took me that long. I used to wake up in the morning feeling groggy and tired for a full hour or so. I’ve since managed to reduce that down to as little as five minutes when I do breathwork. I specifically do a casual version of “box breathing”, which is “Inhale for 4 seconds, Hold for 4 seconds, Exhale for 4 seconds, Hold for 4 seconds, Repeat”. I’m not too strict about the count. What I’ve found is that the holds between the breaths seem to make all the difference when it comes to developing mental clarity.

And stretching turned out to be the answer. If you’re someone who spends lots of time in chairs, you almost definitely have tight hips and hamstrings, and this will have consequences. I am not an expert, but I believe that a lot of chronic back pain that people have is actually tightness in hips and hamstrings that somehow “travels” to the back. There are a few good youtube videos about this. “Foundation 12 minutes” is something that really helps. I also like ATHLEAN-X, and I have a friend from Twitter, @movebetterproj, who’s a physical therapist who’s helped loads of my other friends with all sorts of physical aches and pains.

The core idea is that you want to practice listening to your body, being mindful of the tensions in your body. Are you clenching your jaw, tensing your shoulders? Acknowledge it, and let it go.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Look, I’m not an expert on this stuff, and there are loads of excellent resources from much more experienced people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Record videos of yourself (and take lots of selﬁes!)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is a fairly uncommon suggestion, because I think people haven’t yet adjusted to the reality that it’s now very easy and effectively free to record loads of video footage from the devices that we have with us all the time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This can be entirely for you, you don’t have to show them to anybody else. You don’t even need to put your entire body or face in the frame – although if you’re uncomfortable about that, that too is something to be mindful of. (I have a friend who has an OnlyFans, and she said something like, “I get more nervous posting a smile than posting my tits!” – which I think is absolutely fascinating to consider.) The point of this is to get a sense of how you move, how you hold yourself. This is about studying your own body language.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I recommend setting aside to go through your old Facebook and Instagram photos and paying close attention to your body language. When I look at some of mine, I’m startled to see how much I was clearly trying to minimize the amount of space I took up. I would cross my arms and legs. It’s now clear to me how uncomfortable I was all the time.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Oh, and some selfie advice<span class="p">. This might seem super trivial, but I’ve heard from a lot of men who feel very uncomfortable taking selfies of themselves. I’ve advised friends to literally experiment with “take 100 selfies”, and the tremendous thing is how almost every single one of them reported feeling more confident, even sexy!

Good and Evil can be rather abstract concepts, but we know what love and fear feels like, in the broadest, vaguest sense. We might think of love as “allurement”, or “desire”, being drawn to something or someone, a wanting. We might think of fear as “aversion”, being repulsed, an unwanting, diswanting. The impulse to get away. Want and Not-Want are things that we can see in children, and in our pets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Previously we talked about investigating your desires – getting a sense of what you want, what you’re drawn to.

I&#39;m not scared, I&#39;m a bad person. I&#39;m not scared, I&#39;m bored.&quot; In my experience, <i>this is exactly what fear wants</i>. The last thing fear wants is to be faced head on. Fear wants you to go scrutinize something else. Anything else. Argue with strangers. Rearrange your wardrobe. Question your sanity. Fear would rather you be mad than scared.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Procrastination is often a safety ritual</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It can be “good”, too!

This book has been very difficult to write, partially because of the technical challenges, but honestly, mainly because I’m scared. I’m scared that it’ll be bad. I’m scared that it’ll be good. I’m scared that to make it good, I’ll have to dig into my own guts, my own life, my own feelings, my own story, and I’m scared that I’m not going to like what I find in the process.

And this goes beyond an intellectual, “ok I am safe now” sort of deal. It does help to do breathing exercises so your body feels calm and safe, I highly recommend that. But that’s just the start.

The Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia University, which Wald was a part of, examined the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions and recommended adding armor to the areas that showed the least damage. This contradicted the US military&#39;s conclusion that the most-hit areas of the plane needed additional armor. Wald noted that the military only considered the aircraft that had survived their missions – ignoring any bombers that had been shot down or otherwise lost, and thus also been rendered unavailable for assessment. </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">The bullet holes in the returning aircraft</span><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still fly well enough to return safely</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">to base. </span><span class="s1">Therefore, Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, inferring that planes hit in those areas were the ones most likely to be lost.

A common story is someone using their life savings to start a restaurant without ever having worked in one, or even read about the specifics of the struggles involved. They simply thought that they had a good idea for a restaurant, and then discovered that it’s much harder than they thought it would be.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Failures are inevitable, but the trick is that you can fail early or fail late, you can fail catastrophically or you can fail safe.

You learn what&#39;s right by eliminating everything that&#39;s wrong. You can often do that a lot faster and a lot cheaper than people seem to assume. Then when you win, after decades of putting in the work, and more importantly, avoiding the big open pits in the ground that everyone around you keeps falling into, they&#39;ll say– well, it&#39;s survivor bias!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the best ways to understand something is to understand how it fails.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When it comes to your life, you are both the detective and the crime scene.

I’ll look this up right now. Apparently the most common problem is poor lubrication, which causes unnecessary friction, which causes overheating. Looking at more of the problems – “inadequate fuel and air compression”, “oil deposits and debris”, and I start to develop a mental model of what a combustion engine <i>is</i>. It’s really a system of controlled explosions – igniting the fuel, and so on.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s22">“... somewhere along the line, you changed.

It’s kind of like reading the news and thinking that that’s representative of what’s happening. But it’s not! The news is a stream of some of the worst things that happened. All sorts of lovely things happen every day that hardly anybody hears about. And similarly, just as the news is not an accurate representation of what is going on in the world, your most critical, cruel, hateful thoughts are <i>not </i>an accurate representation of what is going on with you!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Aversion to facing your weaknesses.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This might seem contradictory to the above – it is!

Some people disagree about precisely how rewards should be used. I personally think, for example, that it can be worth rewarding yourself with donuts or other sugary treats when you’re trying to develop a fitness habit, if that’s something you find rewarding. This might seem counter-productive, but we’re playing a long game here! If you develop some kind of attachment to the sugary treats that’s a new problem to deal with, but you can deal with that problem with more confidence, because by that point you’ve built a new fitness habit and you can feel confident about your ability to get things done.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s52" style=" background-color: #424242;">Face your fears</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Your fear is the toughest opponent you will ever face.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You will never defeat your fear completely, and you shouldn’t want to.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Fear is an ally of yours.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Your fear is meant to keep you safe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Your fear will actively evade your scrutiny.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Amusingly, you should try not to be mad about this.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">This is a game of hide-and-seek, and hiding is part of the game.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Put the gun down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Let’s talk it out instead.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">Declare trust bankruptcy (if you need to)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Not everyone is “down bad” so much that they need to do this, but I was, and I’m writing it for people who need it as well. I think even if you’re not struggling so bad that you need to “declare bankruptcy”, it can still be useful to think about. You might maybe think of it as “refinancing” or “restructuring”. Revisiting this section again I realize it’s even more critical than I thought when I first started the book, because you could actually say that Introspect is about learning to trust yourself. If you don’t trust yourself, it becomes very difficult to collaborate with yourself, to make any sort of plan(s), do anything at all. And it’s very dehumanizing to be unable to collaborate with yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How do you build trust in yourself if you have a history of breaking promises?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I agonized over this as a teenager. Turns out the agony isn’t actually necessary. What you need to do is revert to very small baby steps. Start making very small promises that can be kept immediately. “I promise myself that I will drink a glass of water.” And then do that. “I promise myself that I will do 5 pushups”. And then do that. Write it down. Slowly, <i>slowly </i>increase the challenge level of these promises. Rather than “I promise I will publish my book tomorrow”, I have to do “I promise I will work on my book for 2 sessions of 25 minutes each”. I’ve found that going to bed after a day of doing what I said I would do, vs not having done it, is a world of difference. I sleep <i>much </i>better, which has an impact on how my next day goes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The hard part here typically (in my experience, and in conversations with others) is that the ego is in the way. Climbing out of a trust deficit with poor executive function requires doing things that are so small that they can feel insultingly trivial. And they can also seem like they’re not going to make any sort of difference whatsoever when everything feels like it’s going to hell around you. These are illusions. This isn’t to say that the feelings are “wrong” – they are real feelings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s70" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">// The following section of the book is a lightly-edited transcript of a youtube video I made. It</span><span class="s69"> </span><span class="s70" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">might seem a little disjointed from the vibe of most of the other sections of the book. So it is.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Backstory</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’ll start with my backstory. I was a very “ADHD” child, very scatterbrained, curiosity-directed. I never quite learned how to focus. I never quite learned how to set a schedule and follow it. I tried, but I failed over and over again, and it was very demoralizing and upsetting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">School</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Before school, I could just do whatever I liked, whenever I wanted, and it seemed mostly fine. When I went to school, there were timetables and homework and all these structured ways of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">being that you&#39;re supposed to be. I couldn&#39;t do it. Reflecting on this now… my parents ran their own business, so they operated on their own schedules as well. So I didn&#39;t really have much of an example to follow of what it&#39;s like to have a strict schedule of some kind. I also developed the terrible, terrible habit of lying – to say whatever words needed to be said to get people off my back. And I did this internally as well. The worst part – I’d tell myself, “I&#39;ll just play video games or watch tv for a while and then I&#39;ll do my homework later…” and I&#39;ll end up playing, having fun, whatever, for hours until it&#39;s too late. and then I get sleepy, and then I&#39;m too tired to do my homework.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bargaining with myself</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I would bargain with myself. “Okay, I’m too tired to do my homework now. I’ll go to bed, then I’ll wake up at 5am and do my homework then.” But I’d wake up too tired, and very rarely would I ever actually get around to doing my homework. So I’d go to school, anxious as hell anticipating the inevitable scoldings and punishment I would get, and I’d try to get my homework done on the bus. Or, I’d try to do my science homework during math class, and so on. That was just a horrible experience and a horrible existence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Even then the solution was obvious, right? Bro! Just do your homework! Right?! Do it ahead of time <i>before </i>you have fun! But I think the issue was that I had a scarcity mindset. I had no experience of things going well, so I felt like things were <i>always </i>going to go poorly, and so I think the part of me that wanted to have fun – the part of me that was curiosity-directed,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">fun-loving and so on would hijack the rest of me in a panic and insist on binging the fun while it was still maybe-possible. It’s really grotesque and sad to look back on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Competing interests</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I now have the language and the frameworks for thinking about these things. There are competing interests in the mind, like there&#39;s a guy who doesn&#39;t speak up at the meeting and then after the meeting is over he finds some way to manipulate things to get the outcome that he wants. I can frame it in a bunch of different ways – when I frame it in terms of the meeting, it seems a bit sinister. But it&#39;s also like there&#39;s some desperate part of you that&#39;s afraid of the other part of you and doesn&#39;t feel like it has the right to speak up. doesn&#39;t feel… the longer I went not doing my homework and getting into trouble, the more I felt like, “Oh I can&#39;t have fun, I haven&#39;t earned the right to have fun.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And there&#39;s a part of me that&#39;s like, “I have to have fun no matter what, because this is <i>my life</i>, and if i don&#39;t have fun now, then I&#39;m just gonna die miserable. right? because i&#39;ve always been miserable. because i&#39;ve never fixed anything in my life and everything&#39;s just shitty.” I remember what that feels like. I even remember feeling that way at work 10 years later, when I</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">had a great boss, great colleagues and a great work environment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And I could never fully properly enjoy our milestones and our celebrations and so on because I’d always be thinking, “Oh but you know this blog post is overdue or like this deadline, this task is undone and i always just felt anxious and guilty and ashamed in my life. all the time. wow. that</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">was really… it was so unpleasant and you know… nobody was gonna save me from that. right? everybody&#39;s got their own problems, everybody&#39;s dealing with their own shit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yelling at myself did not help</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I remember I was journaling a lot the whole time, and I remember I would beat myself up– i would plead with myself sometimes. I remember very specifically when I was a teenager one day I was crying in the bathroom at home. I was pointing at myself in the mirror, and I said why won&#39;t you fucking study, why don&#39;t you do your homework, like you&#39;re getting into so much trouble, your parents are upset with you, your teachers are frustrated with you, like even your friends, your classmates think there&#39;s something wrong with you… like why do you continue with this destructive path? Why don&#39;t you just do the right thing? I was crying and miserable and sad…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">…and it didn&#39;t help. I might maybe have done my homework that day, but like a couple of days later i was back to how I was before. I feel like I now understand the whole thing better. I have a bunch of riffs about that. One of it is: <b>Negative reinforcement simply doesn’t work. </b>I was trying to punish myself for things that were going badly and hoping that with sufficient</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">punishment for the bad eventually things would be good, and I now believe that that&#39;s a terrible way of approaching things. What I should have really been doing is positive reinforcement for what I wanted. And when things felt too big, I should have gone smaller. But you know, small always feels like not enough. like too little too too late, that kind of thing. But… any progress is progress, and it&#39;s precious. However long it takes and however small it is. Big things start as little things.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It doesn’t make sense to be absolutist</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">To answer the question– what do you do if you don&#39;t trust yourself? you have to unpack that. What does that mean, trust yourself? to do what? Because it doesn&#39;t make sense to talk about trust in this absolutist, essentialist kind of, “either i am a trustworthy person or i&#39;m not” and then it becomes moralizing, right, it becomes like i&#39;m an untrustworthy person because i am</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">sinful and shitty and bad. And you spiral. Whereas, you know it&#39;s not so much a moral problem, it’s actually more of a logistics problem and logistics are solvable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And I know from my personal experience playing video games– I know that I learn logistics in video games and I can execute those things and I can learn skills and get better. But the thing about games is that it&#39;s not your life. You don&#39;t feel a sense of <i>moral failure </i>when you make a mistake in a video game, right. That&#39;s the complication. But the lesson is still to learn is <b>to focus on tiny wins</b>. You might say “I cannot trust myself whatsoever,” – that&#39;s way too broad, way too vague, way too general, and easy to disprove in tiny pockets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The way to earn back your trust or to build trust where there was none, is to do what you say you&#39;re gonna do. So broadly trust is, I trust myself to do what I say I&#39;m gonna do, and people tend to fixate on the “do” part, but actually half the problem, or even most of the problem, can be solved at the “say” part.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You gotta stop making promises that you can&#39;t keep.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You gotta stop lying to people right, and yourself. You gotta instead start practicing making very very small predictions about what you&#39;re gonna do immediately. That can feel silly. Write down, I am going to do five push-ups right. With a little checkbox. Immediately do the five push-ups and then tick the box. It might seem trivial and pointless, but now you can say “I trust myself to say that i&#39;m gonna do five push-ups and do them.” You have just disproved the statement “I am completely untrustworthy”. That statement is now false. You can be trusted to do 5 pushups.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have now earned a little, you know 10 cents of trust.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Then you repeat that. Look around your life – I&#39;m looking at my desk now and I&#39;m like, okay, I am going to tidy my desk a little bit, for five minutes. <b>You have to design these tasks well. </b>You don&#39;t want to say,”I&#39;m going to study today.” That&#39;s too broad, it&#39;s too vague, it&#39;s open to interpretation. You want to break it down to, “I’m gonna spend half an hour working on the math problems from chapter three.” Let&#39;s do that, and then I&#39;m gonna reward myself after that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I know people say things like– there&#39;s this whole meme that I completely agree with, which is like, “you can just reward yourself right away though.” That&#39;s true. I did that for a long time. It did feel like I was getting away with something. The adults in my life would say something like, “You’re only cheating yourself,” and I thought to myself, “Haha, this rules, I can cheat myself and I can forgive myself and everything is fine!” But over a long enough timescale you begin to feel the lack of self-trust, the lack of self-respect, and that’s something that becomes oppressive and frustrating. if you can&#39;t respect yourself, you know, you don&#39;t enjoy yourself as a roommate in your head, then that tension and unpleasantness comes out in your face, it comes out in your utterances, in your body language… it just spirals out of control.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Building trust is an ongoing process.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The point is not to be “I&#39;m the most trustworthy man alive” or like “I do every single thing I say I&#39;m gonna do”. Even now I don&#39;t necessarily do every single thing I say I&#39;m gonna do. But it&#39;s a process. I negotiate. Whenever I feel like I haven&#39;t been doing the things I&#39;ve been saying, I try to suspend the project. I take a pause, I take a piece of paper from my notebook, and i&#39;m like, what do i want to do today, that I can do today? Okay, I&#39;m gonna spend half an hour updating the book that I&#39;m working on. I&#39;m gonna send out this one email. Each small task that you set for yourself, and then do, builds trust. And becoming someone that <i>you </i>can trust is one of the most valuable things you can do with your life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And you can look around – it&#39;s night and day, the people who trust themselves and the people who don&#39;t. There <i>are </i>people who have blind faith in themselves, that&#39;s not who I’m talking about… I&#39;m talking about this cool, calm, measured, almost sleepy casual confidence that comes from knowing that, if you say something, you&#39;re going to make it happen. These people have a gentleness to them that comes from a place of strength.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And it can become kind of subconscious, the way you know you might be able to type on a keyboard without thinking about where each letter is. You can start doing things without thinking</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">about what you&#39;re doing. That might seem very far away for some people, but I have been on that journey and I want to say that it&#39;s possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t necessarily think you need to believe in a grandiose promise of, “Oh everything&#39;s going to be great.” It&#39;s more… you reflect on what was a part of your life a long time ago, or what your state was a long time ago, and consider how your life now is different than it was then, and just consider that all of your experience – which is real, and yours, and true… is still not the whole picture. And there&#39;s a whole world beyond what you have seen so far. Just as you know there&#39;s a whole world– there&#39;s other countries that you haven&#39;t visited that you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, the cultures are different and so on.

It’s interesting how paradoxical it can be – and it all makes more sense once you model yourself as having multiple different “parts” that have different concerns and interests. Some parts of you will be frustrated that you’re not better. But some parts of you will be offended at the suggestion that you’re not good enough. The solution, or the path towards the solution, is quite literally to bring all of these people to the negotiating table and articulate all of their respective concerns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Absolutism / catastrophizing</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This idea that just because you have failed at some things, or a bunch of things, that you can never be trusted with anything ever.

I recommend going to a fancy cafe that you might not usually go to, and bring a notebook.

He thought it would take about 2 years. It took him almost 14.

The coherent self is constructed for interfacing with others. Christopher Knight similarly-ish described how, in his</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">27-year hermit solitude, &quot;I lost my identity.

Because if there were nobody else to comment on it, be annoyed by it, compare yourself to, then it wouldn’t be an issue. We think of ourselves as fast or slow, ugly or attractive, rich or poor, in relation to other people. I wouldn’t assert that this is <i>absolutely </i>true, but I think it’s a useful frame to peer through to consider our issues.

I once wrote a blogpost titled ‘Parents, peers, and other benevolent plagues”. I was really proud of the title because I felt like it very elegantly captured how it can be the good people in our life who hurt us, even without meaning to. And here I have two thoughts – one, that it makes no sense to get angry at them for it. And two, of course we should get angry about it, when we are treated with cruelty, even if that cruelty was borne of ignorance. This is one of those paradoxes that we have to somehow synthesize and find a way to laugh about.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The prestige trap</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 19pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy.

That’s actually a minor example of a Prestige Trap! I must’ve spent hundreds of dollars on books I would never read. I got off lucky. That’s a very small price to pay. Some people spend years if not decades of their lives, tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, trying to pursue an under-interrogated model of happiness, joy, success, fulfillment that they didn’t actually choose for themselves.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">One of the most important things that I hope I can convey to you is this: I believe that you will save yourself a tremendous amount of grief by identifying the ways in which you have unquestioningly bought into your inherited ideas of prestige. You may have inherited them from your family, your friends, or wider society around you. The question I want you to ask yourself is, what did you want before other people got into your head about what you <i>should </i>want? What were you like? What were you drawn to, what did you like to do for fun?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">For me, the first answer is obvious: books. I just always loved books, even if nobody else saw me reading them, even if nobody else cared.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Of course, there are some more complicated answers. I got into music significantly because some of my peers were into it. I now enjoy music for its own sake too, but I’m not sure I would have learned that about myself if not for my peers. We are social beings and I don’t think it’s realistic or desirable to seek to <i>completely </i>strip away all of social reality from ourselves. That strips away our very humanity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Different people of course have different values and preferences in this domain, and I don’t particularly want to sell you on my values – although surely I have accidentally and unintentionally done so already in my writing. But what I really want is for you to consider your own values. How do you feel about the idea of being a monk in a monastery, cloistered off from the rest of the world? Some people find that idea deeply fulfilling. And if that’s what you feel in your heart, I say great, go for it! But the tricky thing is that lots of people are just plain unsure. And they change their minds along the way. And I’d say it’s okay to be unsure, and it’s okay to change your mind. You might even want to experience a change of heart, which I think is something deeper and more profound. I don’t know what the truth is here. I can only talk about my experience and my learnings but they are limited.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Someone’s opinion of you does not have to become your reality.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Les Brown</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cloying pressure of the Cult of Happiness</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I use this phrase in a playful, silly way to point at something that I think is a real phenomenon.

It might be something that someone needs to hear, if they’re really excessively obsessed with what other people think. But we <i>are </i>social beings. No man is an island.

One of the arguments is that “trauma does not exist”, which I straight up disagree with – but it’s an interesting thought experiment to consider – what <i>if </i>trauma didn’t exist? What <i>if </i>we’re perpetuating whatever we’re perpetuating out of familiarity, a sense of identification with some set of events, and so on? (If this rubs you the wrong way, please disregard it completely!)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://twitter.com/wholebodyprayer" style=" color: #424242; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank">Here’s a tweet from my friend Rosalind (</a><span style=" color: #1154CC; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11pt;">@wholebodyprayer</span>), which I feel does a good job of summarizing the entire book: <i>“If you want to be ungovernable, you have to be okay with people having hurt feelings &amp; blaming you for them —because consciously or unconsciously we use feelings to govern each other”</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Thread Time!</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">What I’ve learned from people who DM me their problems</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’ve been learning a lot about people from the dozens of people who DM me every week. A recurring thing I’ve noticed about some anxious, frustrated people is that they haven’t really investigated their ideas about what is good, what they want. They talk about certain ideals (growing an audience, climbing a career ladder, making money) <i><b>like they’re non-negotiable.</b></i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">My perspective is: a lot of the pain comes from friction <i><b>between how someone is and how they assume they’re supposed to be</b></i>. They then beat themselves up about it, and they don’t realize they’re doing it. Psychological abuse appears benign when it comes from inside the house/.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">One guy couldn’t understand why he was so frustrated with life. He was so kind to other people and so cruel to himself. My frame: his self-cruelty violated his own values (“be good to people”), and this violation was a source of dissonance. Self-loathing is a form of narcissism, which is isolating.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Another guy had been really struggling to let go of his jealousy of people that appeared more successful than him. He’s really bought into the idea that having more money etc makes you literally a better person. Our conversations are all just me getting him to say it out loud.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Zooming out, it’s interesting how people will come to me with “please help me” and then resist the most simple questions I ask them about what they want, what they’re trying to do, etc. I still laugh about the guy who asked for writing advice then disagreed with everything I said,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I once had a guy several years ago DM me some really vulnerable confessional stuff about feeling weak &amp; ashamed etc, but then his timeline was full of him being mean to people. He seemed to be at a crossroads and making progress, but I eventually blocked him because he insulted people in my mentions, and I have zero tolerance for that. I still think about that one- could I have steered him off the path he was on? Will he redeem himself eventually? I don’t know, but I cannot allow him to use the people in my mentions as target practice. Was a rather unhappy block. Am never gleeful about doing this, but the alternative is worse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">People often get all apologetic in my DMs about being “pathetic” and talking about their unresolved feelings, but I find it so much easier to love them when they’re open and honest. It’s sad to contrast that with how abrasive and cruel those same people can be in the commons.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">I think what’s coming together here for me is just how profound and powerful it can be to really listen. To yourself, to your conflicting feelings, to others. To be patient and to try to be kind. I’m not perfect at this and I’m not trying to be preachy either- It’s free power!!!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">People feel powerless because nobody listens to them, not even themselves, and then they try to get a feeling of power by being cruel to others - but this is hollow, weak, fragile power created from fear. Real power comes from love. Cheesy-sounding, but I really think this is true. People trip up over this I think because the popular concept of love seems to be something frilly, superficial, trite. Real love is something deeper. It’s a deep acceptance of what is. It’s tolerance, patience, kindness, grace.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s52" style=" background-color: #424242;">Uninstall social bloatware</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Nobody asked to be born.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Nobody was put on this Earth to be someone else’s slave.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You should not have to live your life under the direction of somebody else.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You must find the quiet voice inside you that is yours.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">This voice can take time to find, and hear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You might be in a social environment that directly inhibits your self-expression.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">In a sense, we all are, but some people do have it much worse than others.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Regardless, the thing is to cultivate a space within yourself where you can be free.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Even if that space is only in a journal, as a start.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Practice courage in small ways.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Then you can fan its flame, and slowly become more courageous in bigger ways.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Become who you are.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">Investigate your copes</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s22">“Don’t worry, </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">you don’t have to quit until you ARE ready. </span><span class="s22">[...] You can keep smoking until you ‘get it’!

It’s so easy to point at and talk about. And the interesting thing is, the phrase emerged in recent-ish times in a kind of derisory way – “cope and seethe”, “copium”, the implication being that the person who is trying to cope with something is somehow “less than”. This is a recurring thing in all sorts of domains. Somehow people have even found a way to say “Get help”, “you need therapy”, and so on as an act of dismissal and diminishment, with a little bit of plausible deniability woven into it. Truly amazing how we do this.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Anyway, being the eternally earnest optimist that I try to be, I want to reclaim “cope”, and investigate it with kindness and compassion. I once found myself tweeting, <i>“Cope is when you’re bitter about not getting what you want. Flourishing is when you realize that you are so much more than getting or not getting what you want.” </i>Thinking about it more, I wonder, can this apply to coping mechanisms as a whole? And the big word that I’m a little shy to using: Addiction? Is addiction not a form of cope? And could addiction be “when you’re bitter about what not getting what you want”? It’s surely <i>not that simple</i>, and yet I think there’s a strong enough ring of truth to it that it makes me actually reinvestigate my own compulsive, neurotic behaviors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your coping mechanisms exist to help you</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">This is a very important truth about coping mechanisms (copes) that we tend to brush off pretty easily, I think because we feel compelled to rush to the part about how they are bad for us, and how we are bad people for using them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If I were to be a little dramatic about it, I think there’s something about that that makes the mechanism – or the part of you that’s associated with the mechanism – angry, resentful, mad. It retaliates. It considers you selfish, ungrateful.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Don’t be in a rush to get rid of your copes</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Here’s my unconventional advice– but really, I’m borrowing directly from the Easyway playbook, and those folks have been <i>very successful </i>at helping people quit smoking: I don’t think you should be in a <i>rush </i>to get rid of your coping mechanisms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Again, your coping mechanisms exist because they help you in some way. Feeling guilty or beating yourself up about them will actually make things worse. It sets up an internal conflict within yourself that is often doomed to fail.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">To execute a jailbreak, you have to make attempts to evaluate things as clinically as possible. I don’t mean you have to become a clinical <i>person</i>, but I do think it helps a little bit. Commit to temporarily suspending guilt and shame about how you are, while you neutrally evaluate it. I saw a lady on YouTube who cheerfully helps to clean up depressed people’s messy houses, and it’s an absolute salve for the soul. I highly recommend it. (Search “depression cleaning”.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The beautiful thing is seeing how she walks into a space that’s clearly something that most people would be ashamed of, but she brings to it this cheerful non-judgemental energy of “Oh wow!

It views addiction as an instance of the same kind of desire-driven habit-forming learning that’s the core of our motivational system. And so quitting an addiction is not exactly just quitting something bad. It’s more like a continuation of one’s general lifelong process of learning. This is a kinder framing and it’s thoroughly neuroscientific. And it reveals that addictions are actually very clever behaviors in some ways– so we can even learn from them as we try to develop healthier habits to replace the ones that harm us. </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">It’s also a narrative perspective that respects the subject’s life</span><span class="s22"> </span><span class="s23" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">story.</span><span class="s22"> The addiction was a part of my troubled human journey.

And the thing with coping mechanisms is that you’ll have to reframe your entire relationship with the cope in order to deal with it. Otherwise you have a “don’t think of an elephant” problem, where “trying to quit smoking” keeps you thinking about smoking. You want to instead reframe it to something like, “enjoying the breath”, “enjoying being healthy”, etc.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shame and helplessness make it hard to move forward</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Fear and worry, a sense that they will never unlearn the impulses.

So when we numb those, we numb joy, we numb gratitude, we numb happiness.

And it becomes this dangerous cycle.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">“And it doesn&#39;t just have to be addiction.

I’ve seen people talk about how they do this in therapy – just show up every week or so and talk about the same problem they’ve been having for months, and years. That’s not <i>bad </i>– it can provide some relief – but we can definitely do better. I think a good way to make progress without bullshitting yourself is to take some new (small) action that you&#39;ve not taken before (or recently).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But also, you can live your entire life as a sitcom rather than an adventure, that&#39;s perfectly fine. You can live a life full of safety rituals, and be safe, and warm, and take care of yourself and those around you, and that can be a decent-enough life. It’s really up to you to be honest with yourself about what you really want. You can seek out some external authority to tell you how you should live, but ultimately, submitting to that authority is also a choice on your part. The final responsibility for your life always lies within you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I&#39;m reflecting on how layered it is. The following is a little compressed summary of what so many people are struggling with:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l44"><li><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">There&#39;s some desire in your heart</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">You follow it, and you get burned. Pain!</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">You create a barrier around the desire, lock it up. No more pain.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">But now, no more feeling, either. You now feel cold, desolate, numb.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">The numbness makes it hard to do anything, and you feel bad about being unproductive.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">You beat yourself up for feeling bad. Who are you to feel bad?</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">This internal conflict has you detaching from yourself, becoming apathetic to yourself.</p></li><li><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -12pt;text-align: left;">“Ugh, why am I so bored &amp; listless?”</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And – if at stage 8 you then think the problem is that you don&#39;t have a good enough note-taking system, or some other triviality, you can then end up spending years avoiding yourself and your real issues. Fixating on the wrong part of the problem is also a kind of self-soothing safety ritual. Which isn&#39;t to say that notes can&#39;t help! literally the first thing I advocate for is extensive journalling. But the point – if you really want true relief – is to use the journalling to bring you closer to the root of your problems, and to help you take action to address them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Or not! It is truly entirely up to you. You <i>can </i>bullshit yourself and lie to yourself if you want. That is a choice you can make. I’m not here to judge you. I used to be very bothered when I saw other people doing this but now I feel quite a bit more at ease with it. Each person is on their own journey, after all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Why did it bother me? I was projecting my own shadow onto other people. At some point I had internalized self-loathing re: weakness and incompetence. I grew to believe that my weakness was the source of everything bad in my life. And seeing it in others distressed me. Surely, if I was punished for my incompetence, they will be punished for theirs too? And here part of me</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">tells myself that I want to protect them, but I think the deeper shadow part of me <i>wants to punish them </i>so that <i>they suffer as I suffered</i>.

My father would sometimes be an angry man, and when he was angry he was frightening and dangerous. To his credit, he’s mellowed a lot as he’s gotten older, but even now I still feel a flinch of fear. Also, I grew up – and still live in!– a society which has a trope of “brown men are angry and dangerous”. From a young age, I felt like I could never express anger as a minority, because it would alienate me further. I felt compelled instead to suppress my anger, and to instead be maximally charming.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This does have a positive side to it – being able to turn on the charm is a very useful skillset! But the challenge for me was to unlearn the <i>compulsive </i>aspect to it. To learn to be okay, for example, when some random person dislikes me. Or even when a friend turns out to dislike me. I am not obliged to charm every single person in my life. It’s okay for people to dislike.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Thinking on it more, I further realize that I grew up in a society where, if I said &quot;bad things have happened to me and I am upset about it&quot;, the overwhelming response from everyone else was something like &quot;no they haven&#39;t, fuck you, god you&#39;re pathetic.” Building on what Hayley said, there are people who get uncomfortable seeing any sort of expression that’s outside a very narrow range of what is “acceptable”, and they will express that discomfort by</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">and this sort of suppression and denial goes so deep, it&#39;s so much a part of the air we breathe – right now it&#39;s crystal clear to me that it&#39;s directly related to almost every other problem imaginable, yet nobody talks about it. Even now a part of me is like, &quot;Oh no, are you really going to say that all of society is participating in a conspiracy&quot;. And you know what? Yes! Yes I am! It brings me no joy to say this. It&#39;s been ravaging me on the inside for years to even hold it. But it’s true! Families are conspiracies of silence. Society too is a conspiracy of silence. We brush away things that we don’t like to see, and don’t like to hear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The world was cruel to me, and I denied this about myself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Even now when I read the phrase “the world was very cruel to me”, my subconscious immediately offers negative responses. <i>“The world was cruel to you? Like, you, personally? Fuck off, mate. So many people have it worse than you. You’re not that important.” </i>And so on. And… I don’t think any of that is in conflict! Yes, I’m not that important! Yes, many people have it worse than me! AND, it’s also true that I endured cruelty growing up! That’s the truth, and I am okay saying the truth, and I am okay if there are people who do not feel comfortable hearing that truth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The truth is also painful to admit. Expressing anger, feeling anger, means admitting that I have reasons to be angry, which means admitting that I experienced bad things, experienced injustice and cruelty. And I didn’t want to admit this. Part of this I think is because we live in a rather victim-blamey world. Even if someone doesn’t personally believe that victims deserve what happened to them, it still makes some sense for them to be averse to the victim label, or to even saying at all that they were victimized, because of the unpleasant assumptions that people will subsequently make. And… I can empathize with that, even, because I’ve seen how I do it myself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I have a tendency to rage at cowardice and incompetence</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Iff there&#39;s a sort of &quot;shadow&quot; that I hide underneath my friendly ambitious nerd persona – which by the way <i>is </i>a genuine, honest expression of myself – it might be that I have an intense rage at what I perceive to be cowardice and incompetence. I had a flash of it emerge for me earlier, which kind of shocked and surprised me, so I figure that&#39;s my cue to bring it out into the open and talk about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I think part of it is that some part of me is frustrated with myself for having taken so long with the book that I&#39;m working on. Another compassionate part of me knows and understands that it takes what it takes, but the angry part doesn&#39;t give much of a fuck about that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I don&#39;t like &quot;bottled up&quot; as a metaphor. I don&#39;t think my rage is &quot;bottled&quot;. I think it&#39;s just... deep rooted? underground? It&#39;s like molten lava running through a cave. For the most part I don&#39;t find it necessary or useful to make a show of it. it exists, I express it sometimes I think part of what&#39;s uncomfortable to talk about – some of this stuff is internalized via external social cues. I didn&#39;t invent this harshness, I inherited it. I grew up in some harsh and cruel environments, which is how I learned to be harsh and cruel.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-bottom: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So like, it&#39;s... this double-edged thing, right. I&#39;m reminded of Kratos&#39;s Blade of Chaos from God Of War (2016).</p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="480" height="270" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_071.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There&#39;s something quite cursed about this stuff. Dark, burning shit from a past life that you hope you never have to think about again, let alone <i>use</i>. Kratos really gives me a narrative to set this against. He associates the chained blades (and the resulting scars) with <i>monstrosity</i>, they remind him that <b>he </b>*was* a monster, of all the bad and terrible things he had done in his anger and hatred in his past life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But at the end of his journey he realizes he truly isn&#39;t that any more. &quot;I have nothing more to hide&quot;.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">. <span><img width="474" height="264" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I guess in some way I too have been bandaging up my own arms, being afraid - no... - ashamed? of my own power, my own anger and rage, because the last time(s) I got truly mad,</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">years and years <span class="p">ago, things turned out terribly.

I must have like 20 Twitter threads about this stuff– never summon a demon to destroy your enemies, because it&#39;ll consume everything in the process.

For many years, I didn&#39;t know. There were a lot of things I didn&#39;t know, and I like to humor myself with the conceit that &quot;I&#39;ve resolved most of them&quot; – but anger, rage, contempt is something that has always made me uneasy, something that I’ve never liked to face about myself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I don’t think I’ve ever thought of myself as an angry person, and I don’t think anybody else would describe me as that, either. In fact, for a long time, I was a very conflict-averse,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">conflict-avoidant person. (Although, funnily, I used to hate it when anybody said that about me, and it would trigger me into… an angry response. It’s truly humorous, once you’re able to step out of it.) But I have anger within me. As any person should. And I’m not ashamed of that any more.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“If you’re not angry, you’re either a stone, or you’re too sick to be angry.

The challenge, like Aristotle said, is to be angry the right amount, in the right context, in the right way. That’s hard. It takes mindfulness.

That’s a part of why some of us tend to suppress it. We worry about the consequences. You might feel angry at your spouse but find it unwise to express that, because you’re not sure that you’ll be able to do it in a calm, measured way, and then there would be consequences. You probably don’t want to say anything overblown that you can’t take back.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Journaling can help here. Simply writing down everything about your anger, what you’re mad about, however unreasonable it is, can be helpful. I’m mad at my mom, I’m mad at the world, I’m mad at myself… get it all out. Once you’ve gotten it out, you’ll often feel better immediately, and then when you look at it later, you’ll find that the reality of things is more nuanced than you first thought.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s13" style=" background-color: #000;">Face your anger</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You do not have to be ashamed of your old scars.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Your mistakes and failures are part of your story, but they do not have to define you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You can be more than a victim, or a sinner, or a long-suffering miscreant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">If bad things happened to you, it’s not unreasonable for you to be angry about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Be careful of vindictive, righteous, hateful, venomous contempt – that’s something that leaks and corrodes your very being.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">But anger can be justified.

The result is that we stop doing activities that would nourish us, leaving only work or other stressors that often deplete our resources. Professor Marie Åsberg suggests that those of us who continue downward are likely to be the most conscientious workers, those whose levels of self-confidence is closely dependent on their performance at work, that is, those who are often seen as the best workers, not the lazy ones. The diagram also shows the sequence of accumulating &#39;symptoms&#39; experienced by Jim as the funnel narrowed and he became more and more exhausted.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ouch. I don’t even think of myself as a conscientious worker, but somehow I find ways to get myself exhausted anyway.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="356" height="214" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_076.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tiredness gets progressively worse.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">To be honest, this is one of the hardest things in the world for me. I still struggle with this. I can have a wonderful abundance mindset when it comes to writing. I know that I have an effectively infinite capacity for writing. But when it comes to tiredness, sleep, exhaustion, I really struggle. My sleep just sucks, man. Writing this book made it worse. I’m confident that I will continually get better at this, but this is my weak point.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And what I know, after almost 20 years of struggling with it, is that it has very little to do with tactical things. Yes, I have blackout blinds. No, I don’t bring my phone to bed. I just don’t like going to bed, period. I’ve experimented with many different formulations… the problem is not that. I think the answer, as Rollo May said, is that <b>&quot;the battle for health must be won on the deeper level of the integration of the self&quot;</b>. For me, my issues with sleep and tiredness are clearly an offshoot of some much deeper issue within myself. And maybe a part of me writes a book like this in the hope that writing it will help me to figure out what it is. Ironically, I am currently too tired to see clearly what it is. But I bet I’ll see it after I ship my book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Almost everybody is struggling with something.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In a way, the silver lining of this for me is – my scarcity mindset relationship with rest gives me a window into appreciating how other people struggle with their own. It helps me get down in the trenches with them, instead of lecturing at them from some high-and-mighty podium. I don’t know if that’s a helpful idea for you, as you’re struggling. Sometimes I hear from people saying something like, “I wish I didn’t have to go through all that trauma, all that difficulty, it was such an unnecessary, wasteful, horrible thing.” And… yes, I won’t dispute that. I wish you didn’t have to go through it, either.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But having gone through some version of it, an interesting thing is that it gives you a window of connection with other people who have struggled. There is a deep kinship and communion in that. I don’t mean to romanticize it too much either. It’s tricky and nuanced. But your struggles may allow you to be of service to someone else, to help someone else feel alone. And when you do that, you can feel less alone, too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Leisure is only possible when we are at one with ourselves.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">We tend to overwork as a means of self-escape, as a way of trying to justify our existence.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Josef Pieper, Leisure: The Basis of Culture</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="457" height="324" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_077.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Scarcity mindset</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Sometimes I think the phrase “scarcity mindset” is woefully limited, because it isn’t really something that’s just limited to the mind. It’s also embodied. It’s a feeling in your gut.

Sometimes I’d start – and I’d often get really intense about it, try to be super-detailed and comprehensive, and then it starts to feel too much, I fall off the wagon, and then I repeat the cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I won’t say that I’m an expert at keeping logs – except maybe with my tweets, because I tweet incessantly all the time – but I’ve gotten somewhat better at it over the years, and I’d say the main thing (especially if you’re ADHD like me) is to keep the data entry as simple as possible.

There’s something about the rhythms of other people that has a positive “regulatory” effect. Unless it’s just you and your spouse and you both stay up really late together, then that can have a negative “coupled oscillator” effect. Getting out of the house in the morning, going for a walk, hanging out around a coffee shop or something, these are things that can really help with a sense of “bioregulation”.

And at some level it’s good that I’m experiencing the problem while trying to address it, because it means that I’m for real. I’m not imagining this stuff. It’s a real issue.

Our words fall short. Words like “perceive”, “believe”, “feel”, “think”, are all loaded, they’re all clouded, they’re all approximations. There is a knowing that is beyond knowing and I’m so, so sorry that there is no way to convey it directly in words. I’m not saying this is spiritual or religious… those too are clouded, loaded words. As all words are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">the core thing about Introspect - also just a word, it’s really important not to get hung up on any particular word – is the pursuit of this truth. The unfolding of it. My job is to be a bit of a shaman, a bit of a threshold guardian, and I have had to relive my own terror.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">And my terror is the realisation that there is just no way that I can promise to facilitate this magic for you. I can’t. I’ve written the same book 9 different times to try and “fix” it, and it’s a much better book for it, but the thing that finally breaks through is admission: you cannot explain the Tao, you can at best allow it to explain itself through you. And you have to be okay that it might just not work out. You cannot guarantee a good time, you cannot guarantee enlightenment, it will always elude you if you demand it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">I have been living with this anxious fear that someone will read my book and think “this is bullshit”.

It’s an approximation of the</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">best bullshit I got, but it *is* bullshit. Everything is theatrics and shadow puppets… the point of which is to *get you to see what you already know*. what only you can “explain” to yourself using the language of your own heart, feeling the waves of your own body. “Explain”? also a loaded word. There is nothing to explain. You seek freedom from explanation. And yes, good explanations are tremendously better than bad ones, I have a whole section on this. A good explanation has more of the resonance of truth, truth is a harmony that passes through and beyond the doors of our perception.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">What we seek *is that resonance*. It’s not the *words* of truth, because words are loaded. There is no magic phrase. there is only magic. we want to cultivate the courage to stand before the splendor of existence in our small naked silly cowardly selves and see that we too are Of It, we too are waves in its ocean. Every artist, every author, seeks their own path to conveying this same fundamental truth through the language of their own person. The story is retold a billion times in a billion ways, And That’s Good Actually.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Because it’s not the story that’s magic, *it’s the telling*.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">We have played ourselves for absolute fools, lmfao. And we do this on purpose because we are scared. and we hide our fear, from each other and from ourselves, so that we may go on with the business of living. And to be fair, it’s pretty important business.

Returning to the core glimmer of truth that had me shooting out of bed to write this in the first place: there are some things we know that are truer than others. some things are more fundamental. I can NOT tell you what your truths</p><p class="s44" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">are. your task is to awaken your own resonance.</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: -3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">In between you and your resonance is suppression, oppression, fear, uncertainty, doubt, blah blah all sorts of shit. Again, I don’t know what that shit is. I can make suggestions. Your job is to not take my suggestions too seriously. Don’t listen to me. Listen to you!! I am just a babbling fool. Sometimes a babbling fool can say things that might move you, help you connect certain things, feel more at peace in the world. Would be beautiful if it did. It’s totally fine if it doesn’t.

It can be a metaphor for death. It can represent the threat of non-being, of annihilation. It can also gesture at man’s complex nature, being all at once sacred, mundane and profane. It might represent an “unholy liaison” – between the masculine and feminine, monstrous and human, rational and irrational, spiritual and instinctual, deity and demon, good and evil.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The Minotaur represents the darkness within ourselves. It can represent tyranny. It can represent the dominance of animal instincts. It can represent raw Power, something dangerous and threatening that we feel must be suppressed, kept hidden, locked up, to protect ourselves and others from its destructiveness – ugly, hateful, angry, lusty, selfish, sinful.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We must cultivate sympathy for the “monster” within.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And yet. When choosing a picture to represent the Minotaur for this chapter, I found myself compelled to choose the above image: his mother nursing him as a child. How grumpy and frustrated she looks. Asterius – that’s his name – must have had such a miserable, unhappy childhood, being treated with harshness by his own family.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Sympathy for the Minotaur, I believe, is a necessary part of healing.

We must learn to love the most unloved part of ourselves. Historically, the Minotaur story typically involves the Hero slaying the terrible beast with his sword. And we will always have that story, if and when we ever need it. But maybe we also need new ones.

Oftentimes the problem isn&#39;t just that we don&#39;t know what to do, or that we don&#39;t understand what is happening, but rather, that we have a false idea of things. We are, at any given point in time, pretty much certain to be perceiving things incorrectly. And yet it&#39;s challenging to appreciate this. It’s extremely natural to buy into our own bullshit. (Feynman: you are the easiest person to fool.) The challenge is to patiently, curiously identify this, without being needlessly aggressive or contemptuous about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Confront your inner authoritarian-tyrant</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">The inner tyrant is fearful and insecure, clinging desperately for safety, trying to control outcomes. Some of the worst violence is the violence we do to ourselves when we are afraid of being who we truly are. (Nomi, Sense8). Self-loathing can be a form of narcissism, an unproductive fixation on the self, which is alienating, which is dehumanizing, which is</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">despair-inducing. We have to listen to the pain, and let it go.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 200pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">Put the gun down</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">You cannot bully someone into becoming a better person. Even if you somehow “succeed”, you’ve now taught them that bullying is how you get things done. This is true internally within yourself, too. You cannot install the new way with the old way. You have to put the gun down.</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Violence begets violence. Mistrust begets mistrust. Learn rituals of peace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 177pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;">The dark night of the soul</p></li></ol></ol><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">When you’ve made an effort to dismantle your coercive habits, to walk away from what you don’t want, you might not immediately be flooded with joy and peace. There’s a good chance that you will experience a cold emptiness instead. I believe this is why lots of people struggle to make the transition. Because it’s messy, painful, ugly, and, for a while, completely unrewarding. You have to create the rewards for yourself, and in the interim it may feel hollow, fake, empty, pointless, meaningless. It can be like a forest fire that scours the lands. But new life grows from the ashes.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">// The following two essays were written after I struggled with the rest of the Act. I’ve put them right at the start because I think they capture the essence of what I want to say in this Act.

So I figure I might as well do a wordvomit about it. I know that I’ve done youtube videos about narcissism and self-loathing, which is a subsection of it, but fuck it, I’ll just write a wordvomit first and see how it goes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Alright, where do we start? I find myself thinking about the time when I was a teenager, living with my parents, struggling to keep up with my schoolwork, and I think I had a bad report card or something, and my parents were mad at me about it. I was mad at myself too, and I specifically remember angry-crying in the toilet, jabbing at the mirror and asking myself, </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">“Why won’t you</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">fucking study?”</span><span class="p"> In retrospect, it seems both bleak and hilarious, but at the time it wasn’t funny at all, it was just miserable. I was in despair. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know how to help myself, and nobody around me seemed to know how to help me, either. I felt like absolute shit, like a pathetic excuse for a human being. That was the sort of language I found myself using, and writing about it now I find myself curious to know where exactly I picked up that sort of language. It must have been from others. Maybe my family. Where did they pick it up? Why do we use it, when it’s so obviously ineffective?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">It was only years later when I was working for my ex-boss that I really experienced a different mode of troubleshooting my problems. My ex-boss Dinesh was compassionate, kind, patient, and thoughtful. He was </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">genuinely curious to understand the true source of my problems, to</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">understand the mechanisms of it</span><span class="p">. Having inherited some of his style, I imagine I would now ask, gently and compassionately, </span><span class="s1">“Actually, why aren’t you studying?” </span><span class="p">And I think the difference in these approaches is – when the question is asked from a place of anger, the implication seems to be that we aren’t really looking for answers. We’re looking for contrition. We’re looking for penitence, for remorse. We’re looking to hear, </span><span class="s1">“I’m so sorry, I fucked up, it won’t happen again.” </span><span class="p">But what if you hear that repeatedly? What then? The impulse then is to think, well, here we have a moral failure, folks. A naughty boy. Irredeemable. A bad kid. Maybe if we punish him more, he will learn. Maybe he needs to experience more pain and suffering, then he will change his ways.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">But how are ways changed, really? </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">How does behavior change actually happen?</span><span class="p"> These are important questions that don’t seem to get asked enough. What I’ve come to believe is that each person is a bundle of conflicting impulses, motivations, interests and so on, and can’t be reduced to a singular motive. For lasting behavior change to happen, there needs to be a sustainable consensus amongst the various different parts of the individual. And the individual</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">almost certainly is not entirely in charge of their own behavior. After all, if we were <i>entirely </i>in charge, why does anybody do anything less than optimal? Why does anybody smoke cigarettes, or eat junk food, or stay up too late playing video games? Why isn’t life a simple matter of, “here are the things I want to do, and I am going to do them”? Because the proclamations that we make – I’m going to lose 10 pounds, I’m going to learn a new language, and so on – are often like bold utterances made by the selfish, ignorant manager of an overworked team who doesn’t bother taking the time to get to know them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">To be clear, I’m not saying that having goals is intrinsically bad. I love having goals, and I encourage people to have goals. But the thing is that you have to “listen to your people”. </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">You</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">shouldn’t be making grandiose promises that you cannot keep</span><span class="p">. A lot of a person’s unproductive frustration with themselves becomes a lot clearer, more evocative and, yes – actionable – when you see it as an incompetent manager’s frustration with their overworked staff. Management makes promises that staff cannot deliver on, then yells at them for failing to live up to his unrealistic expectations.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So the question then becomes, how can you stop being such a shitty manager of yourself? Well, let’s pretend you just introduced new management. You can do that! Pretend that the old guy got fired, and you’re the new guy in charge, and you just inherited this tired, frustrated, overworked team. What’s the first thing you should do? I think the first thing is to listen. Really listen. You want to ask your team (that’s also you!), what was wrong about the old system? This feels a little abstract, so let me go back to my teenage self, and the question of “why aren’t you studying?”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Well, I know now with the benefit of hindsight that I had really bad project management skills, and nobody taught me to do it better. I also know, from observing how I actually spent my time, that I enjoyed playing video games, I enjoyed watching anime, and I enjoyed hanging out with my friends. Looking back, I regret none of those things, and in fact I wish I did them even more! But what was the mess exactly? The mess was… I wasn’t doing my homework, for starters, and that was getting me into trouble with my teachers, which was getting me into trouble with my parents, which was causing me great misery and despair. Alright. So… simply doing your homework would go a long way in making your life less miserable, right? Yes. So why aren’t you doing your homework? (And here it’s tempting to say, “You know, everyone else does their homework…” – but that wouldn’t actually help. It’s rarely helpful to compare kids to other kids.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s rarely helpful to compare yourself to other people as an adult, either.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">The first honest answer that I’d blurt out to me, which I don’t think I would have felt comfortable saying it to the adults in my life – and I think the truth can often feel like this – is </span><span class="s26" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">“I don’t want</span><span class="s14"> </span><span class="s26" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">to!”</span><span class="s14"> </span><span class="p">And the correct response from me, the Adult Visa reparenting Child Visa, is to smile, laugh, and say, </span><span class="s1">“Hah, I totally relate. There’s all sorts of stuff I don’t want to do too. You should see me when it comes to dealing with health insurance.” </span><span class="p">And here I think my childself would actually be surprised, just to hear an adult </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">validate the truth of that feeling.</span><span class="p"> Yes, thank you. Thank you for admitting that homework sucks and isn’t worth doing. What an oppressive nightmare. And from here, I would actually take a massive detour, and ask my childself, what do you wanna do</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">instead? And he would talk about anime, and video games, and basketball, and music, and hanging out with his friends, and I would listen attentively to all of that, and ask questions from a place of genuine curiosity, and be encouraging, supportive, excited. This will take hours and hours of time, which none of the adults in my life were willing to spend on me. The impact of this is very difficult if not impossible to measure. But the result is that the child feels less anxious, less cornered, less oppressed by reality. When he feels safe to talk openly about his desires, and be taken seriously. When we wash away the guilt and the shame with the elixir of understanding, the child loosens his white-knuckle grip on what he perceives (quite correctly) to be the last precious little vestige of his selfhood, his sovereignty, his soul.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Confront the minotaur (Pt 2)</p><p style="padding-top: 19pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So in Pt 1 I talked about how I tried to bully myself as a child, how ineffective that was, how miserable, how we are each internally conflicted, and how desperate I think I was, in retrospect, to hold on to my tiny sense of sovereignty in what felt like a cruel, oppressive world. How precious that was to me, and how little of a shit anybody else gave about that. Because, and here I can hear an authoritarian-self bellow, who are you to give a shit about something as pathetic as your soul? You can worry about your “soul” once you have a degree! Once you have money! Once you have prestige, accolades, status! Once you are a big man, then you can worry about your soul! (And I must say: this voice did not arise from within me. I inherited it from those around me.)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And I think even as a child I knew that this was a bullshit ploy. Because I had eyes. I could see. That while there were certainly big men around with degrees and money and prestige and accolades and status, they hardly had any soul. That’s why they bought expensive sports cars and cheated on their wives and had to have multiple heart-bypass operations. To try and fill the void where their soul would’ve been, which they had mortgaged away for mere trinkets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I am eternally grateful to my childself for his stubborn protection of what he felt was sacred, even as he was clumsy about it, and even as he was utterly seized with fear and nausea. I wish I could’ve been there to protect him, to have his back. But the thing is, while I am lucky enough to have made it to adulthood intact, it wasn’t without scars. The mental image I have is – I tried to protect my light, but I was surrounded by darkness, and the darkness actively sought to snuff my light out. I know this mental image isn’t necessarily the entire truth of what was happening, but it is the truth of my experience, it’s the truth of what it felt like to me. Much like how being ostracized from one’s friend group as a teenager can feel legitimately apocalyptic, I felt like the world was actively trying to poison my heart. It really seemed that way, and felt that way. And I think it partially succeeded.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Despite my best efforts – and what could I have done, as a child? – some of the corruption of my environment seeped into my being. And I think that’s very difficult if not impossible to avoid, as a child, because part of what it means to be a child growing up is to absorb lessons from the environment around you. And one of the greatest struggles of growing up, transitioning into adulthood, is to realize that </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">the environment that was supposed to nurture and protect you – and</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">by this we might be talking first about parents, but also peers, and the wider culture we are</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">immersed in – can be wrong.</span><span class="p"> Sometimes terribly wrong. Despite trying their best not to be. We have so many coming-of-age movies about this, where the protagonist learns about the sins and wrongdoings of the father.

I can point to a date when I decided that I was going to start writing the book – it dates back to around 2018 – but the contents of the book? I’ve been studying this material since I first learned to read, and I’ve been working on this since I first started to write. And I have been hemming and hawing about publishing it because it feels like I’m not ready. And I know I will never be ready, the book will never be good enough. But it is time. The day is here. I must live as though the day were here. It’s impossible to fully explain all of the thinking and reasoning and feeling that go into this realization, and I have to make my peace with that, too. There is a knowing that’s beyond explaining.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Okay but what else is there to say about confronting the minotaur, the authoritarian-tyrant of the self? </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">I’ve talked about where I inherited it from, but ultimately there’s an expiration date on</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">blaming other people for your problems.</span><span class="p"> Yes, I was somewhat poisoned and corrupted by the world around me, but it’s since become my responsibility to take care of it, face it, deal with it. I have made pretty good progress with it overall, bit by bit, with the help of art, music, literature, and friends. And I have helped other people with their own, in bits and pieces, in ways that was meaningful to them. Which is why I’m writing this book.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But I have struggled tremendously in writing it, partially because of the technical challenges of writing a book (which are numerous and substantial, though also genuinely interesting), but I think mainly because of fear. It’s always fear. What’s the fear here? I’ve described a few over the course of writing this book. First I was afraid the book wouldn’t be good, in that it would make me look like a bad writer. I think I accepted that, dealt with that. Then I was afraid that the book might be damaging for some, maybe lead them to waste their time. Dealt with that. Then I think I found some deeper fears about the role that I’m stepping into. I’m afraid of becoming some kind of guru figure, I’m afraid of attracting responses from people who are struggling – and that I might not be able to help them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And there was also this struggle where… I feel like, in writing about inner authoritarian-tyrants, my own rose up to resist me, resist being described, identified. Which is kind of funny and in retrospect exactly what I should have expected. It’s just so on the nose: Egos resist being attacked. I really have to put aside my ego to finish this book, and the act of doing that is a tricky and challenging one, and boy has it been a tedious, long-winded dance. And then it tries to protect itself by saying, “see, you took so long, it means you’re not qualified to write this”. That’s always how it is. That voice is never going away. I just have to smile, nod, and finish the book anyway.</p><ol id="l47"><ol id="l48"><li><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: -26pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">Confront the propaganda department of the mind</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“Don&#39;t surrender all your joy</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">for an idea you used to have about yourself that isn&#39;t true anymore.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Cheryl Strayed</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="s79" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">// I know that this section repeats some of what came before.

It can be tempting to describe it as something cruel. You could also see it as something rather small, selfish, cowardly. Or you could even see it as something almost innocuous in its plain neutrality. The Banality of Evil: it can turn out that one of the primary sources of pain and suffering in your life might be something almost insultingly mundane.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bureaucratic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When I think about my own propagandist, I think of it as kind of sad and pathetic. Outdated. Archaic. I’m now getting this mental image of this overgrown man-child who’s spent his entire life operating an old cinema – a tired, grumpy, forlorn man with no friends, no concept of joy, nothing to live for. Just his old movies, which he plays on repeat over and over. I start to feel sorry for him. The world has passed him by. Does he actually believe his own bullshit? Does he believe anything at all? It might seem interesting to try and suss out, but ultimately it really doesn’t really matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The propagandist is always fighting yesterday’s war. He doesn’t quite seem to understand the concept of change. He is haunted by fear, and a distorted view of reality. Somehow, we have to</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">forgive him for his failure – treating him with contempt and disdain achieves nothing – and we have to relieve him of his duties.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“People contain multitudes, coherence is fascism.<span class="s81">”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I first said the above quote as a </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[joke]]</span><span class="p">, but the more I think about it, the more I find that there’s a truth to it.

It’s true! It’s not even really their fault, they weren&#39;t taught better. This entire species is a fractal of shitty management all the way up and down.

And neither am I.&quot; She’s right! It follows, then, that being truly honest – even if only with yourself</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">– can be a <i>very </i>difficult thing to do. It can take years and years to even begin to understand the truth of something, because of all of the context and history that we are initially unaware of.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A dishonest narrative can be composed entirely of veriﬁed truths.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Consider how it’s possible to be dishonest – to present a dishonest picture – that’s made up entirely of verifiable facts. You just have to cherry-pick to create a particular impression, a particular narrative, a particular frame. And we almost can’t help but do this, as humans with limited bandwidths and pattern-matching impulses. We can’t help but create stories around</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">events. If two similar things happen to us within a short period of time, even if we know for a fact that they were entirely random events, it will almost definitely feel personal, and indicative of a pattern. This is very, very hard to resist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">This is a big part of why I insist that you study </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[storytelling]]</span><span class="p"> and </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[framing]]</span><span class="p">, because when you develop a familiarity with those domains, you instinctively find yourself playing around with them, asking “well what if it were the other way around?”, “what other ways are there of looking at this”, and so on.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What <span class="s37">is </span>the propaganda department of the mind?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Why does it exist? Well, why does any propaganda department exist? The point of propaganda is to control the narrative. Why is there a need to control the narrative? To try and control outcomes. Who gets to control the narrative? Typically, whoever has the power to do so, and makes the effort. Why do they want to control the narrative?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Many people live in terror or apathy under an authoritarian regime, led by a vague, limited, selectively edited, imperfect image of themselves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Authoritarianism happens at many scales, it’s about the hubris of thinking that X knows best.

It’s like an optical illusion. It never quite feels like you’re in denial. That’s literally the whole thing about denial. You can’t see your own blind spot head on. You can only really infer it through secondary means.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">This section ties up with </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[journaling]]</span><span class="p">.

That&#39;s what the Crown motif is about, for me. it&#39;s not about power over others. nobody can have dominion over anything greater or lesser than oneself. it&#39;s about conducting oneself with grace and decency, about taking responsibility, refusing self-abandonment, self-abdication.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The disconnect</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The interesting thing to look out for when you’re having conversations with people – (and this is true with yourself too, but it’s harder to do in the moment by yourself, hence journaling) – is to pay attention to their language. Their vocabulary, their grammar, their tone of voice. There can sometimes be a “disconnect” between what they’re saying, and what they <i>say </i>they’re saying. In this moment you realize that they are unintegrated. And it can be tempting to want to point that out to them, but if you try it, you’ll often find that it gets met with hostility, denial, anger. And this too can be interesting the first couple of times, because they don’t even seem to realize that they’re doing it as they’re doing it. Now think about the last time <i>you </i>got mad at someone without quite realizing why.

Isn’t that such an important thing to understand, societally? How is it that people marry their favorite person in the world, and then several years later, become each other’s worst enemies? I think it’s because when you put two people together like that, they invariably step on each other’s toes – or to be more accurate, they invariably poke each other in their unintegrated, traumatized fear-selves – and we are not taught how to navigate this gracefully.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s69" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">// I have a lot more to say about this, but again, gotta ship the book.

And I learned some interesting things about myself by observing them, witnessing them. It became apparent that I inherited so much of their communication styles and their anxieties without realizing it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">How do I talk about this without coming across as angry, bitter, resentful, or like I’m trying to make my parents look bad? They’re only human, and I do believe that they did the best they could given their circumstances, given their own respective inheritances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I’m not sure if I want to go into in-depth detail about my perception of my parents’ imperfections in a book that I’m releasing to the public… so I’ll be a bit oblique here. But basically, several of the things that I thought were my personal failings, turn out to be things that I actually picked up from my parents, and my family environment. And it’s tempting to blame my parents for them once I realize this, but it’s ultimately my responsibility to address and resolve.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">So I’ve had to investigate my communication style, the way I think about time, blame, responsibility, punctuality, expressing desire – all of these are things that were deeply shaped by my parents and family. And this “complex” (core pattern of emotions, memories, perceptions in the personal unconscious) would be a source of conflict for me with my friends, with authority in school, and even within myself. I’m 31 years old as I write this and I think I’ve only just begun to really grasp just how extensively this complex permeates through my entire being. It’s the water that I was raised in.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I think it’s worth saying that I now do feel genuinely optimistic about my progress.

There are other approaches, surely, but this is what worked for me. The challenging thing is, while you can <i>try </i>to explicitly question yourself, and sometimes make some good progress on that front, the real good stuff is what comes up unintentionally. Here’s my recommendation: to do this well, you need to write at least a few dozen pages of stream-of-consciousness, from different states of mind, over a moderately long-ish period of time (say, 3 months).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Talk with people outside your social bubble and feel the difference.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I particularly love talking to kids, because they have a way of cutting through the bullshit with their elegant simplicity.

Try something that is completely unrelated to all the things you typically work on. For me, things like drawing and cooking fulfill this – I don’t expect to be a professional or even a serious hobbyist in those domains anytime soon, so I’m able to approach them as a casual player.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Playfully experiment with alternate narratives.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Humor is an important component here. Children are quite naturally able to experiment with playing-pretend, trying on ideas and roles that aren’t strictly “correct” or “true”. If you have a narrative where you’re a shy person, what if, for fun, you experimented for a month with living like you weren’t? It might be a bit of a leap to try and do an open mic set at a standup comedy venue (although honestly I do recommend this for everyone). I tend to describe myself as “bad with schedules and calendars”, but from time to time, when I’m in the mood, I find myself trying to experiment with them too, and there’s something liberating about it – even when the result is mostly failure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reﬂect on the chaotic, ever-changing nature of reality.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Consider how big the world is, and how small you are.

Any amount of torment and humiliation, is absolutely justified to erase the malignant stain of your incompetence.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A while ago I asked my Twitter audience, “If you’ve ever hated yourself… why?” I got over 200+ responses, and I would say that the dominant theme that ran across all of them was a sense of inadequacy. “I am not enough. I am broken. I am spoiled. I am a failure.” Reading response after response, I felt simultaneously relieved to know that I am not alone, and haunted to realize just how staggeringly widespread this. And these were the people who follow me on Twitter – people who I assume are quite well-adjusted, courageous enough to be able to express themselves, the truth of themselves. So many more people must be having it worse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How do people become authoritarian dictators over themselves?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The same way all dictators rise to power. They take advantage of the fear and insecurity in the air. They promise security, glory, greatness, power. They point at weakness and fan the flames of contempt. Insecurity. What do tyrants really want? Control, power. “To rule the world.” “Immortality.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Why? Fear. Fear of being backstabbed. Fear of being betrayed. Fear of death. Fear of feeling powerless, tormented, taken advantage of, beaten, abused. You can cycle through all of the 7 sins – wrath, lust, greed, gluttony, envy, pride, sloth – and see the fear in each of them. If you’re familiar with Star Wars, Anakin’s story is a potent one to reflect on. His innocence, his torment, and how he really only turned to the Dark Side because he was grasping for the power to protect the ones he loved, but couldn’t. And how he ultimately redeemed himself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">&quot;Nationalism, racism, and fascism are in fact nothing other than ideological guises of the flight from painful, unconscious memories of endured contempt into dangerous, destructive disrespect for human life, glorified as a political program.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Alice Miller, Drama of the Gifted Child</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pedestalization and demonization are both forms of dehumanization.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s actually the same problem. We create a false image of someone to conveniently idolize or despise, ie dehumanize. It’s easier than having to face them as imperfect, nuanced, complex human beings. We also do this to themselves. It’s easier, and in the short run somehow less unpleasant, than facing the messy, “ugly” truth. But the truth is actually beautiful when you really, truly see it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Introspection is about undoing self-dehumanization. And again I feel compelled to repeat – the most humane thing is to collaborate, with yourself, with others. To really do this, you have to really listen. You have to really pay attention. You have to be open to surprise.

Unless we refuse to acknowledge this, refuse to allow it. Because we insist on controlling everything, and making sure things happen in predictable and known ways. That chokes the joy out of life, and then we wonder why we’re so bored, listless, depressed, lonely, empty. When we are in this mode of being, even the companionship of our dearest friends can feel hollow and false – because we know that we are not being ourselves around them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s56" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Trickster Energy</p><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Dismantling authoritarianism takes mischief, frivolity, joy, playfulness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s a good quote about how opportunity gets ignored because it’s disguised as hard work.

It’s messy and chaotic and relatively opaque. Also cheeky trickster energy tends to leak, ie you can’t really get people to fuck around in one domain and be conformist in other domains. because tricksters play *with* boundaries, that’s where the trillion dollar value comes from.

Technically Jobs/Wozniak were committing a crime when they were phreaking phones. Feynman cracked safes for fun. Tricksters are hackers, they reveal security vulnerabilities, poke holes in authority. And they can’t give you a plan for how they’re going to use resources. so it looks incredibly inefficient and wasteful.

But I will reiterate here that I’m still thinking through this stuff.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Narcissism is a heavy and loaded word. There’s a medical-psychiatric context, and I make no claims about that terminology. When I talk about narcissism, I’m talking about it in the more colloquial, mainstream sense. Which itself is a kind of moving target, so I don’t know how this text will age in the future. I think in future editions of this book I might edit it out entirely, but it feels appropriate for now.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Narcissists do not love themselves</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Tthe people who talk about their personal experiences openly – cheerfully inviting others to share their own stories &amp; interpretations – can be the <i>opposite </i>of narcissistic. This is hard for some others to understand. especially those who are compelled to protect their self-image from scrutiny</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Having talked with hundreds of people about their experiences, I’ve come to believe that narcissism is less about <i>where </i>one “points the camera”, and more about how obsessive, needy and fixated someone is on <i>controlling the frame</i>, controlling the narrative.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And you immediately see how tricky this is, because some amount of personal frame control is basic human sovereignty. Every person ought to have the right to choose how they want to present themselves. And who’s to say how someone else should present?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Ultimately I’ve found it’s not any particular set of utterances that makes the difference. It’s how people behave. Some of the loveliest people use the harshest-seeming words but with gentle kindness. Some of the cruelest people smile and use the language of freedom to oppress. I would say it boils down to, <b>does this person respect the sovereignty of others? Do they leave when asked?</b></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I sometimes think of narcissism as a sort of parasitic disease. The ego, originally a helpful construct, swells uncontrollably, metastasizes and seizes control of its human host. The host will then act against its own interests, damaging relationships with others to serve the ego.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Here’s a way I used to think about my self-development: <i>“If I understand my badness well enough, if I develop a sharp enough picture of all the ways in which i’m fucked up, selfish, needy, angry, unfair… then I will be better”</i>. That really didn’t work out. I made <i>some </i>progress but I was miserable the whole time. I was amused to discover that Martin Luther went through a similar version of this. Turns out this problem that I naively thought was unique to me, is something that humanity has struggled with forever.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Be honest with yourself, know what your limits are. Be aware of your failures and shortcomings but don’t let it fester. Seek out people who have the traits you want to have. Wanting to be worthy of their companionship, earning the respect and admiration of others. It’s very hard to do this shit entirely inside your own head, alone. Some people use religion for this, turn to the grace of Christ… if that works for you, go for it! For me, I tend to think about the love of artists and poets and authors musicians throughout history – as I said in the introduction, that’s God for me. There exists a possible ideal of grace and mercy, and we can try to live up to that, rather than try to squash our bad traits. <b>Remember, again, negative reinforcement is very ineffective at behavior change. </b>It’s like “don’t think of an elephant” – it ends up reinforcing the frame, the identity of a sinner, it sets you up for failure. Focus instead on the better version of yourself that you want to become, and forgive yourself as you stumble and falter towards it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="407" height="383" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_085.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">I highly recommend watching Avatar: The Last Airbender, particularly for Prince Zuko’s character development. The show really takes its time to make his journey honest and true, and it can be deeply enriching to watch.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Has blaming yourself ever helped?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">One of the evergreen classic tactics of all abusers is to pretend that <i>they </i>aren’t responsible for anything bad that happens to you. They tell their victims “you brought this on yourself, you did this to yourself”. This can be tricky with other people, but it’s trickiest of all when it’s a voice inside your head. Because, after all, aren’t you to blame for your problems?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">Blame is fucking tricky business! You are </span><span class="s1">responsible </span><span class="p">for your domain, but the very </span><span class="s1">concept </span><span class="p">of blame is hardly ever useful, and you can almost dispense with it entirely. Remember what Brene Brown said: </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">&quot;Blame is simply the discharge of discomfort and pain. </span><span class="s26" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">It has an inverse</span><span class="s14"> </span><span class="s26" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">relationship with accountability.&quot;</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">So the question to ask yourself, with kindness, is: looking back at your own life, thinking about all the times you’ve blamed yourself for your failures and mistakes, all the times you’ve beaten yourself up – </span><span class="s26" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">has it ever helped?</span><span class="s14"> </span><span class="p">Has it ever led to you sustainably making better decisions?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Often, in my conversations with most people, the answer is no, not much. It might work for a short while, but it doesn’t get to the heart of whatever the problem was. It turns out that the blame truly is merely the discharge of discomfort and pain. It’s not helpful. Over time, it makes things worse. What helps, then?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have to listen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You have to face the part of yourself that you think is so monstrous… and you have to listen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="524" height="386" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_086.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Hiko Seijuro, to Fuji (Rurouni Kenshin, 2x26: The Giant vs The Superman)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I return to this scene from time to time because it absolutely makes me cry. Fuji, the giant, was a gentle kid that was ostracized and attacked by society for <i>looking </i>like a monster. He was rescued from near-death by a villainous man who sought to manipulate him and use him for his own nefarious ends. All the classic abuser stuff. “You’re nothing without me, you owe me, you must do as I say.” And here is Hiko, a master swordsman who faces him in a duel. But instead of calling Fuji a monster like everyone else, he sees that Fuji has a sensitive soul, and is a true martial artist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This act of compassion – Sympathy for the Minotaur – absolutely wrecks me. Because I see myself in Fuji, too. Part of it is that I’m really tall (lol), but don’t we all know what it’s like to feel misunderstood?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 229%;text-align: left;">And isn’t it heartbreaking to realize that we might be subjecting ourselves to that too?

They just feel pain, self-loathing, frustration, anxiety, and they don’t quite have a sense of where it’s coming from. It’s the water that they’re in.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: -13pt;text-align: left;">If they realize, they feel powerless.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Oh no, I have a terrible voice inside my head that’s beating me up, insulting me, telling me I’m a horrible person.

This almost never works, for roughly the same reason that it doesn’t work “in real life”. If you assassinate a leader, for example, you might plunge the realm into chaos, or otherwise witness him quickly being replaced by a lieutenant who might be even worse. A bad attempt can be worse than no attempt at all, because it ends up justifying the status quo. So you really have to be sneaky and cunning, take your time. That’s what Act II was about.

You don’t <i>actually </i>need to describe your problems in excruciating detail. Define it clearly, yes, using maybe about 10% of your time and attention, and then the rest of the time, focus on actually addressing the problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Take baby steps towards manifesting the vision that you have for yourself. This might be as “trivial” as drawing a bunch of sketches, practicing the guitar, whatever it is that gives you joy and excitement. It is <i>not </i>trivial. Doing what your heart desires is about rehabilitating your soul. No matter how busy you are, I believe you deserve to set aside at <i>least </i>20 minutes a week for yourself. Even Presidents and major CEOs don’t work 24/7. Even God rested on the 7th day. And you are not God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Experiment with affirmations</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Try reading the following out loud. Slowly. Softly if you’re shy. See how it feels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I love me.”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I look after me.” “I trust me.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I do not take up arms against myself.” “I root for me to succeed.”</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I listen to me.”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">“I hold me to high standards.” “I challenge me to be better.” “I help me grow.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">If these seem too big and feel “fake”, I’d suggest writing your own versions of them that are small and more specific. If “I love me” feels too goopy, or otherwise just hollow and false, maybe for starters reduce it to “I like me” – and if that too seems straight up false, narrow it down to “I like it when I…”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Maybe you like it when you go for a walk.

I don’t believe in “fake it till you make it”. I think it’s important to be honest. The thing is to find small little things that you can be honest about in a positive way, and then strive to expand that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Step outside yourself and evaluate the relationship you have with yourself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Specifically, consider it as if it were a relationship between strangers, or friends, or a parent and a child, or a manager and their employee.

And yet, sometimes, I noticed that they got somewhat less distressed over time, from having a conversation maybe every other week or so, over a few months. Maybe it turns out that what they needed was that they needed to just talk to someone repeatedly over some period of time. I’m not going to claim to have</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">single-handedly changed their lives – ultimately each person is responsible for themselves, and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">it’s what they did for themselves that likely made the real difference. And there have been people I haven’t really been able to help, either. But I think it’s worth trying.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Frivolity<span class="s14">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Sitting down to have this conversation with yourself can feel trivial, silly, frivolous. Or it can even feel kind of insane. I read a tweet by someone saying something like “indulging in a little mental illness to motivate myself by pretending that I’m a character in a video game”. I totally flipped out reading that. I mean, I’m completely supportive of this, but how terrible is it that people feel that it’s “mentally ill” to indulge in a little imagination? As long as you’re not hurting anybody, and you’re not outright deluding yourself that your imaginings are reality, imagination is such a critical part to how you have fun and enjoy life! Children understand this! It’s so, so sad that we lose the joy of childhood imaginings. There is no rule that this is how it has to be. Growing older does not mean we have to lose our sense of joy and cheer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Paranoia associated with the perceived necessity of being capable of violence</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Sometimes people feel that it’s important that they possess the <i>capacity </i>for violence – just in case. I’m quite sympathetic to this. I do personally think – and I don’t mean to impose my views on anyone else – that men, in particular, ought to aspire to strength and power, if they are capable of it. But the whole point of having strength is to be able to nourish, support and protect what you love. You can have a gun <i>and </i>still choose to put it down. Think of the classic martial artist riff: that you learn to fight with the intent of never having to fight.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it.

If you can be exposed to therapeutic people, if you can have access to a good therapist, that’s great. For me the first real therapeutic person that I met in my life was my ex-boss. But before that I had musicians and artists. I highly recommend immersing yourself in art that inspires and nourishes you. Assemble an altar of your favorite work and treat it with genuine reverence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Forgive yourself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Here’s a thing that might seem frivolous, but absolutely works, and it’s much more powerful than you might think.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l54"><li><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Make a list of all the things that you feel regret about, shame about, embarrassed about and so on.

Do it. I recommend actually talking to yourself out loud, or writing out loud in your journal. “Dear Visa. When you were 16, you…. I’ll admit, I feel some shame and embarrassment about that. That was not cool. Can we do something about it? Can we make amends?”</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Do it!

Really feel it, really understand it. It might take a while to internalize. Note the part about the negativity loop – “practicing interrupting the negativity loop may help you break similar loops in your daily life.” It’s absolutely true. Literally breathing is something that you can get more skillful at doing, and doing that can give you a sense of calm and confidence. Deep breathing can help you feel safe, less anxious, more confident, more awake, more aware. I recommend doing it first thing in the morning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="500" height="625" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_089.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s73" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a href="https://anengineersguide.com/" class="a" target="_blank">https://anengineersguide.com/</a> <span style=" color: #424242;">by PearShapedComic</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s13" style=" background-color: #000;">Put the gun down:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">You cannot bully yourself (or anybody else) into becoming a better person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">Even if you “succeed”, the underlying lesson you learn is that bullying is how you get things done.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 143pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 229%;text-align: center;">Try to expand your awareness.

I’m thinking now of the feeling I had when I was walking to work, sometime around 2014 or 2015, maybe, when I felt really vacant, empty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Self-development can be self-alienation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Around the same time – this was years before I had any sort of audience on Twitter – I made the excruciating decision to leave a group-chat of friends that I was very close to, and almost entirely reliant on for my social needs. I had gotten married, a job, and a mortgage, and I had different challenges in my life than all of my friends, most of whom were still in school. I still love all of the people in that chat, but there was something about the dynamics of that group-chat that made it no longer right for me. It was a lot of unproductive whining and complaining – we all knew it. I knew in my heart that I had to walk away from it. But it took me a long time to work up the courage to do it. I told them that I was quitting all groups to focus on my work, which was</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">true. Around the same time as this, I also made the decision to stop blogging about local news and politics, which was at the time a large source of meaning for me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The right decision can still feel painful and empty at ﬁrst.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And it really hurt when I left, even though I knew it was the right decision for me. It didn’t feel good at all. I felt empty. I felt withdrawal symptoms. I felt alone. I felt cold. I didn’t have any kind of support group of anybody who understood what I was going through. In retrospect, though, that experience made me strong. The process of becoming strong that way is really ugly, and I wouldn’t particularly <i>recommend </i>it. I don’t think it’s necessary. I did the best I could at the time, but I can see in retrospect that it was a harsher path than necessary. I think there are better ways to become strong.

Where does courage come from? One of my favorite tropes in stories – TV shows and so on – is when an older character who has been through a lot of pain and suffering makes the momentous decision to once again risk heartbreak and disappointment. It makes me cry, every time. For me it’s a reminder that it’s never too late. You <i>can </i>always start again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.

So it’s very difficult to just think your way out of it. You will have to do a lot of self-reassurance. You will have to introduce new rituals of self-soothing, rituals of peace and comfort.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“What we call the beginning is often the end.

If you instinctively flinch and think “No, I am not interested in doing that,” I would say, alright then, don’t worry about it for now. There is no rush to any of this, there is no point forcing yourself to any of this. But it <i>is </i>the final curtain. It <i>is </i>the thing that comes for us all in the end. And in a way, the pain of every transition is a kind of death. Being born is itself a death of the womb-state.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Entering adolescence is a death of the child-state. Entering adulthood is the death of adolescence. And yet, at each step of the way, we carry some of the past self with us. We carry our inner child with us always. And I like to think – even when we do die a physical death, our spirit carries on in the lives of those that we touched.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Steve Jobs: “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Read about people who have struggled.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You are not the first person to go through the dark night of the soul, and you will not be the last.

Sometimes I think it can be good, actually, to rip up the altar, cast away all the talismans, gnash your teeth at the futility of all meaning. Good! Good! Let it all out! Fuck it all up! This feels like risky advice, because I don’t know you personally, and I don’t know how far you will take it. You don’t want to do anything outright damaging to yourself or others. I want to assure you that the emptiness and despair <i>will not last indefinitely. </i>It ends eventually. You want to keep that in mind. You want to have a thread that you can hold on to, even as you scream and cry and yell in despair.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reconstruct the sacred.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It will feel like you’re wandering miles in the desert, or jungle, choose your own preferred metaphor, and in the midst of despair you will realize that it’s truly the simplest, most fundamental things that matter. Being alive, for the sake of being alive. How even the breath is delicious. The feel of wind on your skin. This is hard to feel when you are clenching your muscles in tension and agony. You will eventually have to let go, whether by choice or by simply collapsing from exertion. Some people experience a renewal after some kind of “burning platform” moment, sometimes a major illness or injury, or some life crisis. In those moments, it becomes clear what’s really important to you. And if you’re lucky, you will get to rebuild your life around that.

It’s such a small gap– I’m practically there already – and yet. several things going on I think. one is that I’m thinking about people who misunderstand me and my motivations etc– but really the true tragedy is how that then leads to me partially misunderstanding myself, doubting and second-guessing myself. and the other thing I guess is the sheer weight of the burden of absolute responsibility for oneself, and how much of my life has been a story of neglect. all I ever wanted to do was to love the world and be loved in return, but apparently you can’t do this without also getting kicked in the face.

No one has led him into direct and healing experiences of the inner world of the masculine potentials.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I don’t know if it’s realistic to expect anyone to suddenly “get themselves together” after reading a single book, but my hope is that if I’ve done my job well, I’ve provided you with some tools and perspectives to help you at least <i>begin </i>this process. It can take years. Parts of it will be painful, frustrating and tedious. But making progress will be deeply fulfilling. I believe that Moore and Gillette are right: we need to undergo deep transformations to get ourselves together. In the</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">absence of ritual initiations and ceremonies, we must come up with our own.

I’m obviously advocating for something like “A year of intense personal journaling” – but to be clear, that’s my personal preference, and it isn’t necessarily what will work best for you. I recommend digging into your childhood memories and past experiences to find what resonated for you. What’s something that you’ve always desired, always wanted, always loved? Take something from that, and turn it into a series of projects.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">I’ve said earlier that projects are anything that requires collaboration, and that collaboration is humanizing. To collaborate with yourself over time requires, sooner or later, collaborating with every part of yourself. The bigger the project, the truer this becomes. So what I recommend – and this might be the thing that differentiates my take from more placid advice – is that you </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">seek</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">to accomplish progressively larger and more difficult projects.</span><span class="p"> It could be deadlifting 3x your bodyweight. It could be running a marathon. It could be making a movie. It could be writing and recording an album.

Simply attempting large projects isn’t a <i>guarantee </i>that you will integrate all of yourself. Just like how going to church won’t necessarily make you a better person. The projects are merely vessels, contexts, situations in which you <i>can </i>challenge yourself. For me, writing this very book is one such challenge. It’s taken me 3 years to put it together. And honestly, I’m not totally satisfied with it. I feel like I could’ve done better, I feel like I could’ve done more. And that’s part of the process. I’ve had to confront my own perfectionism. I’ve had to celebrate my own wins, embrace my own mistakes. When I publish this book, I intend to get a tattoo to commemorate the accomplishment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You don’t necessarily have to write a book! Writing books is what <i>I </i>wanted to do ever since I was a kid. The question is, what do <i>you </i>want to do? And how will <i>you </i>help yourself get to where you want to go? Clichés like “it’s the journey, not the destination” really do apply here. Define an exciting journey for yourself, and <i>go.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">✱</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“For most of us, “enlightenment” isn’t a sudden awakening, but a slow process of shining the light of consciousness onto those rejected, forgotten and denied impulses within.

It&#39;s because the Shadow is 1. amorphous, and 2. almost never what you think it is. Literally the first move in the Shadow&#39;s playbook would be to misdirect you into thinking it&#39;s something else. That redirects the scrutiny and keeps it safe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but I know myself well enough I think to know that if I were my shadow I would want me to be investigating very hard into something that is not the actual problem. Always Be Misleading The Authorities!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Which isn&#39;t to say that the shadow <i>can&#39;t </i>be identified, or interfaced with, or integrated. but you have to respect how tricky and sneaky it is. By definition, it is trickier than you. And by “you” I mean your conscious self, the flashlight of your conscious attention. Wherever you point the flashlight, the shadow likely isn’t.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What people struggle with</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“There is no generally effective technique for assimilating the shadow. It is more like diplomacy or statesmanship and it is always an individual matter. First one has to accept and take seriously the existence of the shadow. Second, one has to become aware of its qualities and intentions. This happens through conscientious attention to moods, fantasies and impulses. Third, a long process of negotiation is unavoidable.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">– Daryl Sharp, Jung Lexicon</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shadow isn’t obvious – it’s like dark matter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What we think our problem is, most likely isn’t actually the problem. It’s fundamentally slippery, evasive, avoidant. Are you familiar with the concept of “dark matter”? Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that makes up ~85% of the universe, yet can’t be observed directly. It’s existence is <i>inferred</i>. Similarly, I feel like psychological shadow entities can’t be observed directly, but we can <i>infer </i>that that they exist, because they leave evidence that can be observed</p><ul id="l60"><li><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">if we are patient and sensitive enough to discern it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The shadow makes us uncomfortable.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s typically whatever we’ve separated from ourselves as “not us”. It doesn’t feel like who we are. We’ve typically been socialized, from infancy, even, to repress our shadows. And repression is something that takes effort. This effort becomes unconscious – we don’t even notice that we’re holding our breaths all the time, that we are tense.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The process of integration is painful.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It’s uncomfortable. It’s ugly. It can make us confront things that we’d rather not confront. It can make us rethink and re-evaluate our past in ways that we don’t like. It can force us to reexamine our identities, our self-concept. It can be exhilarating to find out that we are more than we are, but it’s also scary.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s60" style=" background-color: #000;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.”</p><ul id="l61"><li><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 217pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">Carl Jung</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="603" height="183" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_096.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">The above image illustrates the shadow modes of the 4 main archetypes in King, Warrior, Magician, Lover.

Revisit your childhood desires, analyze your journals, old social media posts, look for clues. Ask your friends and family what they’ve noticed about you. Go somewhere different – I recommend going somewhere with a nice view, ideally in nature, but grand city views can also be excellent – turn off your phone, and just sit. Look into the distance and see what comes up. Who are you? What is your story? What do you love? What are you about?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Feeling drawn to things that they don’t want.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 19pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What if I enjoy it?”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBsaJPkt2Q" style=" color: #424242; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 11pt;" target="_blank">Part of it is fear, a sort of hate-watching.

Many people are drawn to things that they cringe at, that disgust them, that they despise. This can be intoxicating and addictive – a form of cope. If this is something you do, I don’t judge you for it – it’s pretty widespread – but I will say that cutting this out will be a significant, important part of your journey towards accepting the darker parts of yourself. </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">It’s very difficult to stop mocking yourself</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s16" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">if you are simultaneously still mocking other people.</span><span class="p"> </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[Put the gun down]].</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What if I’ll be alone without it?”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Cringe isn’t the whole of it though. Part of it is social, and in there too is fear. There’s a fear that if you don’t keep up with all the awful things that your friends keep talking about, well, what else is there left to talk about? It can actually be lonely choosing to be a happy, well-adjusted person if your starting conditions were hostile, abrasive, and the norms around you dictate that you’re supposed to whine, complain, mock, taunt and so on. But the cool thing is that the world is a very big place, and there are always new friends waiting for you that you don’t know about yet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s also actually something to be optimistic about here – I believe the nature of social norms means that a lot of people who are casually cruel to others, don’t particularly intend to be. They just haven’t learned a better way to relate to other people yet. And sure, maybe there are some people who will <i>never </i>unlearn their cruelty. But we don’t have to focus on them. We can focus on the people who <i>can </i>change, if given the right nudges.</p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What if the problem gets worse when I wasn’t paying attention?”</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Thirdly I think there’s another class of fear, which is that if you don’t point at problems and talk about problems, they will get worse. People often feel that it’s the morally responsible thing to do to keep up with the horrible things in the news, even if there isn’t anything they can particularly do about it in the moment. To this I would say, you really have no obligation to stay fixated on what is terrible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">And I’m not saying you have to delude yourself into pretending that there’s nothing bad happening in the world, either. But rather, the thing here is to be mindful of your information diet. I would say that I’m personally always concerned about the ugliness and cruelty in the world. I’m always angry. But I try (and I’m not perfect at this) to channel that anger into creating things that I want to see, that I believe will be a countermelody to cruelty. The point is to focus on building the world that we want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What you can do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: center;">“Paying attention is a form of reciprocity with the living world, receiving the gifts with open eyes and open heart.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Robin Wall Kimmerer</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Continually return to what you want.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It might seem like there’s a bit of a “broken clock” aspect to this – isn’t it tedious and mundane to repeat yourself over and over again? And I will say to that, no, actually. It really depends on how you do it. If you do it thoughtfully, attentively, paying attention to the nuances, then repetition is something that is enriching rather than numbing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This rhymes quite a bit with how some people worry that marriage will be boring – because aren’t you seeing the same old person every day? Don’t you get bored? No! Because neither of you are the same person every day. We are always undergoing a process of becoming.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">To a beginner, novelty is newness. To the master, novelty is nuance. Newness actually gets kind of predictable over time. If you go on dozens of first dates with strangers and then never go on a second date, even if you’re meeting different people each time, there is a numbing sameness to it – you never get to experience the nuances of developing a relationship with someone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The same is true with any craft or skill that you want to develop. If you go to dozens of “Beginner 101” classes – and to be clear I do think this is better than nothing! – you will never experience the joy of getting better at something over time. It’s worth going to those classes to get a sense of how you feel about each thing, so that you can then figure out what resonates with you the most, but the next important thing is to <i>pick something and stick to it for a while. </i>At least a few months, enough to experience real progress, to do something that you couldn’t have done in a week or two!</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consider how to reframe what you don’t want, in terms of what you want.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">This is a </span><span class="s27" style=" background-color: #F2F2F2;">[[framing]]</span><span class="p"> exercise, and an important one. Being able to articulate what you don’t want is better than nothing, but being able to articulate what you </span><span class="s1">do </span><span class="p">want makes it much likelier that people will be able to actually give it to you.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A lot of people struggle to articulate what they want simply and clearly. There are a range of reasons for this. They’re afraid that if they ask, they will be rejected. Somehow it seems more painful to hear “no” than to hear nothing. But nothing is a kind of no, if you think about it. It just feels like less of a <i>rejection</i>. A big part of developing maturity and equanimity is learning to not take rejection personally. Very few things in the world are truly personal. Even your parents’ imperfect parenting is less about you than it might seem, and that’s probably the most personal-seeming thing in the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Commune with the ancestors.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="506" height="208" alt="image" src="%40visakanv%27s%20INTROSPECT%2C%20v0.9_files/Image_098.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“We are descended from voyagers.” – Moana (2016 film)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">However alien you feel, you are not the first person in the world to be like you. The world is a big place that’s been around for a long time. Somebody, somewhere, has lived the life you are living, or want to be living, and they have written about their experience, as a gift for you to read and learn from.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When I say “the ancestors”, I don’t necessarily mean your literal biological ancestors. You can have “spiritual” ancestors too – people who cared about what you care about. I feel a kinship with bookish nerds throughout history: Marin Mersenne, who’s described as “the post-box of Europe” and “a clearing house for correspondence between eminent philosophers and scientists”. Desiderius Erasmus, an orphan who corresponded with hundreds of people over thousands of letters. The mere fact that these men existed gives me courage to do my own version of the same thing. I’m not just some weirdo bumbling in isolation. I’m a part of a greater tradition across space and time. This gives me courage and confidence to carry on the work of my predecessors.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Consecrate an altar of your ideals.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Remember: A talisman is any object that’s charged with meaning. An altar is a house of talismans. A ceremony is any process of meaning-creation. A temple is a ceremony hall, where meaning is reconstituted. You are the primary person responsible for managing the meaning of your life. And you can make your life more meaningful <i>just by thinking about it. </i>You can do this entirely inside your own head, but I recommend further externalizing that into your environment</p><ul id="l62"><li><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">the clothes and jewelry you wear, the books you read, the art you hang up on the walls.</p></li></ul><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Seek out good relationships that bring out the best in you.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When I talk about this with people, the interesting thing I find is that people almost always already have relationships with other people in their lives that they respect and admire, and yet they don’t spend a lot of time with them. They typically feel shy or nervous, there’s some sense of “that person is so well put-together, they’re doing so well, I would be a mere distraction to them if I tried to reach out.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">In my experience, this is usually false. well-integrated people are lonely, actually, because they&#39;re not common. and they are usually quite happy, excited even, to help someone else along the path to their own integration. The fact that someone has the &quot;I&#39;d just be a tedious distraction to them&quot; feeling is a great sign, actually, because it means that they respect other people&#39;s time and attention. This makes it much less likely that they&#39;ll be the annoyance that they worry they&#39;ll be.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I do recommend taking a bit of time to think about what you want to say before you say it. A specific sincere compliment (always a welcome gift, if you&#39;re genuine) and a specific question usually goes a long way. Sharing a detail about your own journey also helps.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Thread Time!</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">On skillful indifference</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">An oversimplified way to think about life is that it&#39;s about learning the appropriate amounts of indifference to things. I don&#39;t see how you can truly learn this without first getting it wrong, and even then, because things are always changing, there&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll adapt correctly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Obviously, each person&#39;s context is unique. A phrase I&#39;ve been hearing lately is &quot;they&#39;re still fighting the last war&quot;– this rhymes with the general sentiment about the systematic mistake parents tend to make with kids, raising them with intuitions informed by <i>their </i>own experience.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The general process of working through trauma could be framed as, &quot;teaching your body to stop anxiously, agonizingly, <i>repeatedly </i>fighting the last war&quot;. The opposite problem also exists – you could have the problem of extreme indifference, being so indifferent that you do the equivalent of mindlessly walk into oncoming traffic. Conveniently though I don&#39;t really have to talk about that because those people aren&#39;t reading my stuff.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A thing that I was tripping on while researching my book – investigating: what is fear really? – it&#39;s interesting how much of it involves the <i>perception </i>of safety, of control. While I’m not yet confident about yelling this from the rooftops, it seems to me not a huge exaggeration to say that you can absolutely meme yourself into becoming a more courageous person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">A thing I love to say when I get DMs from a clearly anxious kid (I&#39;m old enough now that I can call 25 year olds kids, ha ha) is when they say &quot;I&#39;m so worried/anxious/etc!! omg!!!&quot; and I get to respond, &quot;That&#39;s good, it means you&#39;re smart!” This usually surprises and confuses them. Now, it&#39;s not that I can <i>definitively </i>know that they&#39;re smart just because they&#39;re freaking out. But because it deviates from their expectation of where the chat was going to go (I think they usually expect something like “don’t worry so much”), I get to confuse them out of their pattern.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I similarly like to making weird faces when I encounter a crying child in public. It confuses them, and when they’re confused they stop crying. Confusion is powerful. It’s powerful because when you realize you don&#39;t know wtf is going on, then you can actually start thinking, analyzing, questioning, figuring shit out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Again, the problem with problems everywhere isn&#39;t that people don&#39;t know what is going on.

In The Lion King, Simba had to leave the kingdom in order to undergo the transformation he needed before he could return to take his rightful place as the true king. Steve Jobs similarly had to be fired from Apple before he could evolve into a better version of himself, return and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">turn the company around.

I think some part of me would sometimes issue challenges – to myself, to the universe – “Am I wrong? Am I wrong about how fucked up everything is?” And no, I wasn’t. There’s much in the world that’s fucked up. But I see now that that doesn’t mean <i>I </i>have to consider <i>myself </i>a fuckup. I don’t have to treat myself with cruelty. A friend observed that my old voice lacked self-compassion, and he was right. Introducing self-compassion has made all the difference.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s31" style=" background-color: #424242;">What people struggle with:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“At the moment of victory, tighten the straps of your helmet.”</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">― Tokugawa Ieyasu</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They quit – and worse, they beat themselves up for quitting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">They give up.

If I regret something, it’s that I regret beating myself up about my failures, flinching from them, feeling ashamed about them.

These mice were then allowed into “common areas,” some space that was different from their homes. Then, they were then subjected to loud, intrusive noises. All the mice scurried home immediately, </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">even the ones raised in hostile environments, that were then in more</span><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s17" style=" background-color: #FFF1CC;">pleasant environments afterwards.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">“I guess home is home even if it&#39;s hell,” I wrote in my notes. There’s something quite depressing about this. It implies that maybe early childhood experience is destiny, and there’s no running away from our history. But… also, we are not mice. All this really tells us, I think, is that it’s possible that we might impulsively seek out familiar environments, familiar habits and routines, even if we know they’re bad for us. I think that corroborates with my experience, and with a lot of what I’ve seen, read, heard and learned about other people.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">But also, I believe that it’s possible for us to <i>heal </i>from our childhood traumas. We are not mice. We can deliberately seek out nourishing environments, nourishing relationships.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s a great scene in the first episode of Netflix’s Jessica Jones, where our protagonist is in a state of shock after witnessing something terrible, which reminded her of her own past trauma, and she leaves the scene in a daze… and then she makes the resolute, heroic decision to turn around and head back to face the problem. People can do that. It’s hard, it’s terrifying.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it can be done.

And there’s nothing wrong with failure. Failure is an opportunity for learning. For discovery. It’s where the magic is.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So dare greatly. Fail greatly.

But it’s painful, it’s hard, yes. I have fallen off many of my wagons many times, and I feel bad about quite a few of them. But when I am at my best, I realize that there’s actually no point feeling bad about failing. That doesn’t mean that I should <i>suppress </i>feeling bad. I should simply feel my feelings, and then seek to move on from there. Experience the disappointment and regret, and then resolve to learn from the experience.

It’s okay to make mistakes. Return to your stories. Remind yourself of what you care about, why you care about it. Take screenshots and photographs of things that inspire you, make you happy. Kind things about you that people have said. Put these in a folder on your desktop, and revisit it whenever you’re feeling low.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Practice [[project management]] – map out your next [[baby steps]].</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">It does crack me up how this motif seems slightly discordant with everything else in the book – so much of everything is about feelings, and then this is about… logistics. But logistics matters! You have to develop the capacity, the knowledge, the skill, to get things done, so that you can take care of yourself, so that you can take care of others. The important thing is not to moralize about this. Being bad at project management doesn’t make you a bad <i>person. </i>Thinking in those terms is largely self-defeating.

That’s a trap. Paying it forward is about giving gifts without any expectations. You cannot <i>demand </i>that people accept your help. It’s best to offer it, lightly, freely, without conditions.

What is the heart of Introspect? It’s about undoing</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: -39pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">self-dehumanization. Why do people dehumanize themselves? Pain, fear, suffering. Somewhere along the way something bad happened and</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -5pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">self-dehumanization was a way of preventing the bad from happening again. But the problem with self-dehumanization is that it cuts you off from anything good happening, too. You end up feeling cold, isolated, alienated, desolate. And this can feel deserved, like the appropriate punishment for having caused pain and suffering. Like you don’t deserve to be human, because you’re a monster, and monsters should be locked up in labyrinths, away from humanity, where their neediness and ugliness can’t hurt anybody else. Right?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: right;">The funny thing about this book – and I talk about the importance of humor! – is that in writing a book about dismantling one’s inner authoritarian-tyrant, my own inner tyrant rose up within me to seize control of the project. He insisted that this book must be perfect, or I would be a failure, a disappointment, that I would have wasted the goodwill of my friends that I have painstakingly worked to earn. And I can’t proceed until I find the courage to laugh heartily in his face. “No one will respect you once they see how long and hard you’ve had to work to produce utter mediocrity,” he threatens. “No one will love you when they see what a failure you are. No one will ever forgive you for this.” And here – this is the power of stories – I borrow the strength of Tris from Divergent. “You’re</p><p class="s33" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">wrong,” I get to tell him. “Because I will.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">Recurring motifs throughout this book</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This section is entirely made up of recaps! We will just revisit all of the things that we’ve talked about throughout the book. If anything jumps out at you, make a note of it, so that you can do something about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be playful.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Be sketchy and sloppy and mess around. Give yourself space to make messes. Don’t take yourself so seriously. You could pretend that you’re role-playing as someone else. If you’re afraid to tweet with your name and face attached, you can create an account that’s anonymous. I recommend trying something that’s in a domain that doesn’t have any great emotional significance to you. If you’re a writer who’s very invested in the idea of writing well, I recommend being playful in the kitchen, where it doesn’t matter if you’re cooking something terrible. Cook (cheap) terrible things! Revel in the terribleness!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be kind to yourself<span class="p">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There is kindness in the world too, and you should seek it, but the most reliable way of encountering it is to create it yourself. There’s a lot of unkindness in the world and it tends to move fast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cultivate a sense of humor.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is related to playfulness. It’s also something that I find lacking in a lot of severe, austere types. Being able to laugh at yourself, being able to laugh at your situation, is something that diffuses tension, alleviates anxiety. It gives you a broader perspective, and to introduce a lightness to your approach to things. Joke about the outcomes you want!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take baby steps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You don’t have to take drastic, dramatic action(s) before you’re ready. What’s the smallest version of the thing you’d like to do? Suppose you’d like to write a novel. Could you write a few tweets worth of micro-fiction? Maybe you don’t even need to be the author yourself – pretend that you’re a bad author, and then write bad fiction on behalf of that bad author. Have <i>fun</i>!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Take <span class="s37">lots </span>of baby steps.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">There’s something magical that emerges from volume, as long as you’re paying attention. This is something that’s really counterintuitive to people. I’ve even found it counterintuitive myself, despite having experience doing it.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Embrace failures.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">When I was depressed, I remember journalling something like, “every success is just a stepping stone to a greater failure.” What I would now say to that is “yes, and that’s not a bad thing!” See, embedded in that statement is the assumption that <i>failure is bad</i>. And sure, it’s rarely fun to fail at something, especially when you let other people down. But failure is always also a learning opportunity, if we’re able to lay our arms down long enough to pay attention to what actually happened, and to examine how and why it happened. So get out there and fail a lot. It’ll probably hurt, though you may find that when you have an expanded… tk</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Celebrate small wins.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This is how you get to “spirals of success”.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Do little experiments.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">This is kind of a repetition of the baby steps point, but it’s a little more advanced. Baby steps can meander in any direction. Experimentation is a little more deliberate. It’s taking steps in some deliberate-ish direction with the intent of finding things out. Some people find themselves getting bored with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Write things down.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Adam Savage of Mythbusters once said (quoting ballistics expert Alex Jason), &quot;Remember kids, the only difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.&quot; So <i>write it down</i>.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Be playful.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Lists are very simple and powerful tools for making sense of things. When you generate a list of thoughts “on the fly”, there’s usually something revealing implied by the list that isn’t immediately obvious while you’re writing it. Identifying, observing and analyzing these implications will lead you to a higher-level understanding of yourself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Practice thinking out loud.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Thinking is more powerful than it seems. There’s this great bit in the book “Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman!” where Richard Feynman describes how, in his youth, he used to fix radios by thinking about them. You spot flaws and errors in your thinking much more easily when you make your thinking explicit, ideally in a medium that allows you to revisit it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Talk to people.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">While introspection is an inward-directed process, it’s something that you don’t have to do alone. In fact, I highly recommend that you talk to as many people as you can. Read as many books as you can – that too can be a form of conversation.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Listen to your body.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">The body does “keep the score”. If you disregard your body, it will find ways to protest your actions. Developing an antagonistic, adversarial relationship with your body will lead to a frustrating, unpleasant life. Seek instead to develop a symbiotic relationship with your body.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Practice gratitude.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">You can be grateful to your own body, and mind, for having served you thus far. You can be grateful to specific people who have helped you on your journey. You can be grateful to your favorite books, movies, art, music, and even to more abstract things like language.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="h3" style=" background-color: #424242;">What I was hoping to do:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l63"><li><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">I have a lot of actual material from my journals (in<a href="http://visakanv.com/1000/" class="s65" target="_blank"> </a><span style=" color: #1154CC; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 11pt;">visakanv.com/1000/</span>, particularly) that I would love to weave into the entire book, but I haven’t had the energy to review and revisit it properly while simultaneously working on the book.
